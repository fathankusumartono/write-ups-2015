## Write-up

<div><h3>Poetry of hacking</h3><p>Site says that we can use "_" as a filler for letters that we've forgot.</p>
<p>Check whether we can use "<em>" it w/o any other letters replacing all letters in word "byron" with "</em>" and making a query. </p>
<p>We got a quote! So now just append one "_" to the querry until you get the flag.</p></div>
