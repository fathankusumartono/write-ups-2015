## Write-up

<div><h3>Highly professional</h3><p>We need to find company owner name, so the first step is to determine the company name. Looking at given photo we can read "AllSafe". </p>
<p>Asking Goolge for <code>"AllSafe"</code> give us tons of links, but what if we add <code>computer security</code> (we know that company is engaged in computer security from the task) we get the links telling us that it is a company from TV series "Mr. Robot". </p>
<p>Now just google for <code>mr robot allsafe onwer</code> and get the answer - Gideon Goddard</p></div>
