# Hack.lu CTF 2015: Dragbox

**Category:** Exploiting
**Points:** 350
**Solves:** 10
**Description:**

> We don't like using the cloud at school, so we made our own school internal file sharing service. It is innovative! Just drag (that's why it's called Dragbox) a file* into a share you created in the program and instantly share it with everyone else who knows the secret share name! This is simply the best** way to collaborate*** since the invention of the internet!****
> 
> * dragging and dropping might not actually be implemented yet
> ** might not be objectively true
> *** excessive collaboration on homework is discouraged
> **** timespan of bestness is not guaranteed
> 
> Your goal is to download the file /flag (in the server's filesystem root).
