# Hack.lu CTF 2015: Petition Builder

**Category:** Exploiting
**Points:** 400
**Solves:** 6
**Description:**

> Some students who like complaining too much set up a petition platform in order to solve their problems. Unfortunately it is abused to avoid learning and to get teachers fired.
> Now a teacher who was removed from the school without a solid reason (the students just didn't like the subjects he taught) is seeking for revenge and asked you for help. He already found the platform the students have used to get rid of him.
