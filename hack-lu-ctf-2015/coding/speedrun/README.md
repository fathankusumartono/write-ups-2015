**Description:**

> This goddamn budget cuts. Everyone knows that the computer science class is the most important class today. But as soon as the school does not get enough budget from the state, they shorten down the computer science class. And others like history class are not affected by the budget cut. Like this stuff is important today ... it's history, right?
> 
> Now you only have a one hour computer science class instead of a two hours class. This is an outrage. Everyone knows that you need a two hours class to walk through your game completely. You can already hear them say "Oh look, now he can not finish his game. What a douche!". But you will show them. You only need to optimize the decisions you have to make in your turn. And then you will beat this game in time!
