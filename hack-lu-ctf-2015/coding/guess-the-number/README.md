**Category:** Coding
**Points:** 150
**Solves:** 52
**Description:**

> The teacher of your programming class gave you a tiny little task: just write a guess-my-number script that beats his script. He also gave you some hard facts:
> 
>> he uses some LCG with standard glibc LCG parameters
>> the LCG is seeded with server time using number format YmdHMS (python strftime syntax)
>> numbers are from 0 up to (including) 99
>> numbers should be sent as ascii string
> 
> You can find the service on school.fluxfingers.net:1523
