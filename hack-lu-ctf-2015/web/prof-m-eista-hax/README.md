**Category:** Web
**Points:** 300
**Solves:** 17
**Description:**

> Professor M. Eista Hax uses a digital tool to manage all his students. He is very happy with the system, but it does have one drawback: it does not support multiple users. This is a problem, because M. Eista Hax has employees who need access as well. To solve this he writes a super modern, highly encrypted web application to share the password with authorized users. Problem solved.
