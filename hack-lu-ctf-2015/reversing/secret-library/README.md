# Hack.lu CTF 2015: Secret Library

**Category:** Reversing
**Points:** 200
**Solves:** 71
**Description:**

> Books are a great thing. And since libraries are a big amount of books you can read in one place, they're great, too.
> 
> But this secret library some guys started is a bit different. You have to know the exact title of a book to get it, you can't look around. So you have to know another person in the library who knows some book titles or you won't be able to read anything. A bit like an invite-only library.
> 
> This whole thing seems weird. Could you poke around and try to figure out what they're up to? If you could grab one of their books, that would be awesome.
