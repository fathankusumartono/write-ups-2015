# IceCTF 2015: 2x0r

**Category:** Cryptography
**Points:** 80
**Description:** 

> <p>So it turns out that repeated XOR isn't exactly secure. After realizing this, Idobe Corp decided to create a much more secure standard, which it calls 2x0r.</p><p>They provided a sample implementation [here](./2x0r.py).</p><p>They also dared us to get the flag! Ofcourse, we take no such challenge lightly. Beat it out of them if you have to! [encrypted](./encrypted)</p>

**Hint:**

> Does doubling up really make things harder? Oh, and they said they were so confident in their new encryption that they used short keys.
