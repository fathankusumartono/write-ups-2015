# IceCTF 2015: Sausages

**Category:** Cryptography
**Points:** 200
**Description:** 

> So our friend Steve challenged us to hack into his server. You can access it at <code>ssh -l ctf -p 2222 vuln2015.icec.tf</code>. He remembered to turn off password authentication though. Oh, we also found his GitHub account, it's <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/icectf-steve'>here</a>.

**Hint:**

> <p>This time you'll really have to break RSA. There's something wrong with his key, can you find it?</p>
