# PoliCTF 2015: John Pastry Shop

**Description:**

> Among his hobbies, John likes baking cakes to eat during the warm afternoons in Milan. He is damn good at this such that, a couple of months ago, he decided to open a pastry shop on his own. The shop was an immediate success and John needed to bake just so many cakes that he decided to outsource the production of his famous NewYorkCheeseCake to another external and trusted pastry shop, the Shamano's (see shamanoPastryShop.pem). John provided Shamano's with the original basic recipe of his Cake (see Cake.java) and, after his customization, Shamano returns to John a cake container holding the NewYorkCheeseCake (see ShamanoCakeContainerEncoded.jar). Notice that Shamano has to follow John's directions carefully and that is why he always have to encode properly his cake containers so that John can verify all of them accordingly to a fixed decoding process (see extract of source code in Decode.java). John always tries his best for verifying the quality and genuineness of the incoming NewYorkCheeseCake but, you know, to busy people, like he is, it may sometimes happen to forget to check something... You can find the shop at
