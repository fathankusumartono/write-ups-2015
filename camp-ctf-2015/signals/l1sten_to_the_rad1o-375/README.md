# CAMP CTF 2015: l1sten_to_the_rad1o-375

**Category:** Signals
**Points:** 375
**Solves:** 3
**Description:**

> We saw a strange signal which is repeated every second on exactly 2.5GHz at the [Chaos West Village](https://www.google.de/maps/place/53%C2%B001'54.8%22N+13%C2%B018'25.0%22E/@53.0319,13.3069333,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0).
>
> You got one of those rad1o badges. Maybe you can record the signal, find the correct demodulation and retrieve the flag.
>
> Please be in the vicinity of the given coordinates. The signal is not very strong.
>
> If you experience problems (no signal, disruption of other services due to the transmission etc.), please call Andy on his DECT number 4335.
