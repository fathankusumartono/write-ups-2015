# EasyCTF 2015: All Zob's Fault (350)

**Category:** Cryptography
**Points:** 350

**Description:**

> Apparently our crypto program didn't store the correct phi-value or something for this [message](https://github.com/EasyCTF/easyctf-2015-writeups/blob/master/files/all_zobs_fault.txt); it spits out gibberish when we try to decrypt it. Either the memory had a rare fault or Zob's being an idiot again. Please help.

> 
> Hint: Zob works at the Russian Space Agency.
