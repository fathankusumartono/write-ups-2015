# EasyCTF 2015: Matrices (575)

**Category:** Cryptography
**Points:** 575
**Solves:** 
**Description:**

> Looks like Zob tried to make his own encryption algorithm again; [here's](https://github.com/EasyCTF/easyctf-2015-writeups/blob/master/files/matrix.java) the program. [Here](https://github.com/EasyCTF/easyctf-2015-writeups/blob/master/files/message1), [here](https://github.com/EasyCTF/easyctf-2015-writeups/blob/master/files/output1), and [here](https://github.com/EasyCTF/easyctf-2015-writeups/blob/master/files/output2) are two messages encrypted with the same key and the plaintext of one of the messages. Convince Zob to stop trying to make his own ciphers!
> 
> 
> Hint: Technically, all the math you need for this problem you learned in Algebra 2.
