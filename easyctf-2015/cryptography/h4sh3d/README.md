**Points:** 200

**Description:**

> We discovered that Varsos's server uses a fairly insecure hash function to check passwords. The hashed password is `c9b5af9864efa933`, and the hashing function can be found [here](https://github.com/EasyCTF/easyctf-2015-writeups/blob/master/files/hash1.py).
> 
> 
> Hint: Seems like working backwards will be a pain. Is there any easier way?
