# EasyCTF 2015: ADoughBee (500)

**Category:** Binary-Exploitation
**Points:** 500
**Solves:** 
**Description:**

> ADoughBee Incorporated has released their [FlagEncrypt](https://github.com/EasyCTF/easyctf-2015-writeups/blob/master/files/adoughbee.rar) software. But it seems that unless you unlock the software, you can't really do anything! I know that `evil@anomat.cf` has a working license, try to find their serial number!
> 
> 
> The serial is 25 characters long, alphanumeric. When you submit the flag, don't include `easyctf{}`.
> 
> 
> Hint: How does the program check your serial?
