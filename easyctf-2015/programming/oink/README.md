> 
> Pig Latin is a &quot;secret&quot; language in which English words are changed to sound foreign. Its rules are pretty simple:
> 
> 
> * If the English word begins with a vowel, add &quot;yay&quot; to the end.
> 
> * If the English word begins with a consonant, move the first letter to the end and then add &quot;ay&quot;.
> 
> 
> For example, &quot;Apples are Delicious&quot; becomes &quot;Applesyay areyay eliciousDay&quot;. Note: if you know a version of Pig Latin that uses a variation of rules different from the above rules, please use the above rules for this problem.
> 
> 
> Your job is to translate English input to Pig Latin output. For this exercise, keep capitalized letters capitalized, even when they are moved.
