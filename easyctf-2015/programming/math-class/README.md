# EasyCTF 2015: Math Class (50)

**Category:** Programming
**Points:** 50
**Solves:** 
**Description:**

> Use the programming interface to complete this task. You&#39;ll be given a math expression, such as `add 1 2` or `subtract 5 3`, where you will perform the operations `1+2` and `5-3`, respectively.
> 
> 
> ID:&nbsp;`math-class` 
> 
> 
> Input: An expression in the form of `operation operand1 operand2`, separated by spaces. Read input from `math-class.in`.
> 
> 
> Output: The **absolute** value of the evaluated&nbsp;expression. Your output should always be a positive integer.
> 
> 
> There are only 2 different possible operations, addition and subtraction, and all operands will be integer values between 1 and 1000. As always, remember to end your program with a newline.
> 
> 
> Hint: Two very useful functions are `int()` and `split()`. Read about them in the documentation.
