# EasyCTF 2015: San Francisco Symphony (75)

**Category:** Linux
**Points:** 75
**Solves:** 
**Description:**

> Who knew musicians could program? They put a flag inside `/problems/sfs/sfs`! But when I run the program, it's not printing out the flag. Find the flag!
> 
> 
> Hint: Darn. That `c` file isn't going to help much either. How can we find the flag using only the binary?
