# EasyCTF 2015: Same Difference (125)

**Category:** Linux
**Points:** 125
**Solves:** 
**Description:**

> *Solve this problem by connecting to the EasyCTF shell, either in your browser or through some other TTY.*
> 
> 
> We've noticed that a list of passwords has been modified. Compare the original `master_copy.txt` to the `suspicious.txt` and tell us what the password was changed to! The files are on the shell server at `/problems/same_difference`.
> 
> 
> This can be solved only with the tools available in the shell. No scripting languages are required.
> 
> 
> Hint: There's a pretty cool Linux command called `diff` that might be useful for you.
