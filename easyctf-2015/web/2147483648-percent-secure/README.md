**Description:**

> Hack my friend's [website](https://www.easyctf.com/static/problems/intro-js/index.html)! From what she tells me, it's super secure. Why don't we prove her wrong :)

> 
> Hint: Don't try to figure out what the messy JavaScript code means. [Developer tools](https://www.google.com/search?q=developer+tools) help a lot in things like this.
