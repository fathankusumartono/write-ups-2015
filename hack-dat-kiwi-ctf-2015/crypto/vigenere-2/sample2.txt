 To navigate much easier through this guide, I added the search system, which
works just by following these simple steps:

- Highlight the "Section Code" of the section which you wish to go and copy it
  (CTRL+C).

- Press CTRL+F to bring up the search sub-menu.

- Paste (CTRL+V) the "Section Code" and press ENTER twice to be where you
  wanted to be. Just like magic!

 My Section Codes were made as precise as possible, and I also prefer this
method instead of having you scroll 30 min through this huge guide looking for
the section you want to go.

 Howdy and welcome to my Chrono Trigger FAQ for the DS version of the game. Why
write another guide for the game?! Well, I'll give you the answer I'll always
give... I love the game and well, getting another guide posted for the SNES or
PSX versions of the game is nearly impossible, I'll give it a shot with this
version, as well as because I like this version more than the others, just
because it's a mix of the previous + some more things.

 The fact that I'll be co-writing this FAQ with a good buddy of mine makes it
even more special. I've tried co-writing in the past with Gbness, A Darkstar
Ripclaw, Mighty Oracle and shadow_571, but the projects were never finished.
Anyway, enough of me rambling and time to get started with the good stuff, no?
There're some things I want to address so please read the following paragraphs:

- I'm writing this for free and because I like this game (just like I mentioned
above). If you are looking for tons of eloquent ways for me to say "move here,
grab x item and go N to the next area", you are going to be so disappointed.
This guide is way, way too big to begin with, and lofty language does not help.

- If you take a quick scan thru my guide, you won't find the explanations for
battle basics, main menu, saving-loading, etc. Why, you ask? Well, because the
game manual and in-game tutorials do a perfect job explaining 'em.

- The usage of abbreviations. When you're in my place or any who writes for
GameFAQ's or any other page, writing a guide for any game of such proportions,
people complain about using too many abbreviations. You have no idea how
helpful abbreviations are. It also looks better in every aspect you think.

- My guide is not the only one out there. I'm not forcing you to use mine, but
if you use others, then you better be prepared for lots of spoilers, which will
ruin the element of surprise for you, as well as to get you lost in the
walkthrough (like what happened to me when I tried to use some of the FAQ's in
the site). Also, people that have problems with how I write my guide are from
slim to none.

- The spoilers are great issues in making guides. I am a player of the game,
just like you are. The first time I played through this game was completely
by myself. I didn't read any spoilers, therefore nothing was spoiled for me.
All the story's ups and downs that were supposed to surprise me had such
effect. And I really think it's not fair spoiling such story elements to you.
Even if I want to spoil it to you, I'll bite my fingers so you can get the most
spoiler-free walkthrough here.

  Hey guys, I'll keep this short since vin said pretty much everything I would
have wanted to. I've always LOVED Chrono Trigger, and have always considered
it to be one of the greatest CLASSICS in the RPG genre, so when Vin asked if
I wanted to write it with him I had to say yes!

 With all this said, let's start with the guide! Enjoy this guide and remember
that it is spoiler-free, so you don't have to worry about important info of
the game being spoiled.

 Any critics, suggestions, spelling mistakes, contributions are welcome, so
please send them at the following e-mail:


                           --> vinheim@gmail.com <--

 I always reply to all the mails I get, since feedback is the best reward of
all.


o Important
-----------

 The only sites allowed to host my FAQ's from here on out are the following:

- www.gamefaqs.com
- www.supercheats.com
- www.neoseeker.com

 This is because many sites either steal my guides or they don't update them,
making it really hard on me because many readers from other sites often ask me
question from an incomplete guide, so this is a better way to keep track of my
FAQ's and my readers. Please, if you're not on the list above, don't even
bother asking about hosting them because the answer will be NO. Thanks.
-----------

 I also have MSN and AIM, but please, if you add me, do NOT start bombing me
with IM. If I have the time, I'll chat to you, since I'm always busy writing
FAQ's and making some research for my job and school, but please keep it
polite, 'k? Anyway, here they are:

MSN: xander_may_cry@hotmail.com
AIM: vinh3im

 Ask politely and I'll add you. I don't have YIM, so start mailing me to make
one just so you can chat with me.

 Also, I created a Facebook page for you to check it out here:

o http://www.facebook.com/vinh3im

 This was made because several people like to add me on Facebook and since I'm
not accepting people I don't know, and I removed the people that added me
(sorry for that), I created this page, so enjoy.


 -= Bkstunt =-
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

You can also email me with any input you have into the guide (Vin and I talk
together a lot anyways). My email is:


                        --> gregorio31 @ gmail.com <--

I do my best to check everything I get, although I'll outright ignore emails
that I can't understand or have no meaning.

==========
FOLLOW ME!
==========

Want to talk about some games!? Maybe throw out some ideas for what YOU want
to see me write about next? I made a facebook account for just that reason!

You can 'Like' me at:

   ====================
   Facebook.com/Bkstunt
   ====================

I also have a website you can visit to see what other guides I've written,
as well as see upcoming projects. I've also written a TON of reviews that will
go up there (You want to play GOOD games, right?!).

   ===========
   Bkstunt.com

So between those two sites, come on over and say 'Hi!' sometime.

 This is a little experiment of mine and I just wanna see how it goes. Well, if
you found this guide to be at least somewhat useful, think about donating some
money. I mean, I'm a student who pays his own school, and it's gastronomy and
it consumes all the money I get at home. I'm not asking for 10-20 bucks.
Whatever your heart wants to give is fine, be it 1 buck, 50 cents.

 Whatever the amount you can donate, I'd truly, TRULY appreciate it and your
help would be greatly appreciated. Well, you can only donate through PayPal at
the moment, which the account is: vinheim@gmail.com
                                  -----------------

 Instead of buying the official guides which cost around 20 dls., better donate
half or a quarter or whatever amount to yours truly.

 To those who support me, thanks.                  - Alexander Paul Kleinheider

                    A chance encounter amid the festivities
                 of Guardia's Millennial Fair in Leene Square
                       introduces our young hero, Crono,
                        to a girl by the name of Marle.

                     Deciding to explore the fair together,
                 the two soon find themselves at an exhibition
                    of the Telepod, the latest invention by
                         Crono's longtime friend Lucca.

                  Marle, fearless and brimming with curiosity,
                    volunteers to assist in a demonstration.
                   Hoewver, an unanticipated malfunction sends
                  her hurling through a rift in the dimensions.

                       Taking hold of the girl's pendant,
                       Crono bravely follows in pursuit.
                      But the world into which he emerges
                      in the one of four centuries ago...

                         Journey to the forgotten past,
                               the distant future,
                        and even to the very End of Time.
                    The epic quest to save a planet's future
                            makes history once again.

at the kingdom's Millennial Fair, an unexpected chain of events forces Crono to
plunge into a dimensional rift in order to rescue a girl he had only just met.

   ~-~  MARLE  ~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~

 - Element: Water

 A cheerful young girl who collides with Crono near Leene's Bell at the
Millennial Fair. She volunteers to serve as the guinea pig in a demonstration

when something goes terribly wrong. Her strange pendant appears to have some
connection to what occurred.

   ~-~  LUCCA  ~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~

 - Element: Fire

 Crono's friend since childhood, Lucca enjoys tinkering with machines and is

unfold.

   ~-~  FROG  ~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~

 - Element: Water

 A solitary knight who lives in the Guardia of the Middle Ages. Frog disappears

"reptites" in a never ending struggle. Ayla is fond of strong warriors and
strong drink. She has a passionate fighting spirit and will tackle any opponent
for the sake of a friend. Disdaining the use of weapons in battle, she prefers
to fight with her bare hands and feet.

   ~-~  MAGUS  ~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~

 - Element: Shadow

 Possessed of incredible magical powers, this king of fiends exists in the
Middle Ages. Magus leads a massive army in a campaign to conquer the world.

 Author notes:
  This is how it works:

- My lv.: I'll be displaying recommended levels, or even my levels, for every
area. Remember that the levels are only a reference. Go at your own pace, with
levels higher or lower. I am not trying to force you people to play the game
the way I played. Also, the characters on the upper line are the active party
while the ones on the bottom are the reserve party.

- Gold: The total amount of Gold you obtain in the area.

- Items: All the items you obtain in the area are listed here. You're shown the
whole quantity of the area here. Also, it's only usable items.

- Equipment: All the equipment in the area goes here. All armor, weapons and
accessories are in this space.

- Key Items: Items located under the Key Items section of the game come here.

- Enemies: I'll be displaying the enemies that you will be encountering in that
area. I'll be writing BOSS, SUB-BOSS or OPTIONAL BOSS next to the name of the
enemy denoting THAT enemy is a boss. I'll be also adding their HP and their
elemental weakness.

 So please open up the case, take out carefully Chrono Trigger DS and pop it in
Slot 1. Now turn on the DS, watch the totally kickass opening and song and when
you get to the title screen, select New Game, pick up your Game mode, Battle
mode and movies; and then let the magic begin.

 Name the main character of the game. For better purpose of this FAQ, his name
will remain unchanged. Crono, 'tis your name.

"Crono, are you still sleeping?" -- Crono's mom


 Alrighty, time to start this baby up. After Crono's mom wakes him up, play
with your setting if you want and you'll be given tutorials about the menu's
revamp. Pretty nice. Now go downstairs and speak with mom again. Name Lucca
(which will be her default name) and afterwards, speak to mom again to get your
allowance... 200G...

   <vin> Wow... only 200G. Well, I'd wish MY mom would give me at least 50G XD.

 Anyway, leave the house and we need to go to the Millennial Fair at the N
side, but before going there, there are some places we can go as of right now,
and we can get some items and Gold as well, so I recommend going. If you don't
want to, please feel free to head over to the next area.

 At the Overworld (1000 AD)...

   <vin> That's what I'll be calling when you're on the Field map, Overworld.
   I'll also be putting the time period.

 Enter the Mayor's Manor (green house on the S of the little town), and speak
to the people here. They teach you how to do stuff and whatnot. Meh. You can
also grab the chests in here, so open the chest right after passing by the
running kid to find 'Potion'. Now go upstairs. Speak to the old guy and after
listening to his explanation, speak to him again and you'll receive '300G'.
Nice.

 Also, open up the chest to find another '100G'. Now leave the manor and enter
the Inn. If you speak to the blond chick in front of the piano on the right
side and pay her 10G, she'll play a little song for you. Love it =3. Now, if
you enter the room at the very top, you'll find a black box on the NE corner.
These are chests and can't be opened at the moment. I'll list you all those
you'll find whenever you're able to open them, so don't worry about forgetting
about these.

 Now leave the Inn and go right to the Ferry Office. You can pay 10G to get to
Porre, or you can walk down there. Either way, go N a little bit and enter the
Guardia Forest. In here, go E at the fork and S at the second one. Here you'll
find your first enemy, Amanita, three of them. They go down in one hit, so meh.
After the little fight, check the NE corner here to find a blue glow on the
floor that contains 'Strength Capsule'...

   <vin> I recommend you fight here a little bit just until you learn Crono's
   Cyclone Tech. It will come in handy.

 Now go S across the right bridge outside the forest to find Lucca's house. You
won't find anything of importance there, but go if you want to. Go S a little
more and you'll eventually get to Porre. The Inn charges 20G. Expensive.

 Enter the Mayor's Manor on the left side and speak to the Mayor on the right
side. He'll give you 10G if you humiliate yourself. Meh, not worth it. But you
can do this over and over and over. Infinite amount of Gold here. Go up to the
second floor and open the chest to find 'Shelter'. If you enter the Snail Stop
and speak to the monster Piano player, he can either play a sad song or an
upbeat one. Awesome songs, both of them.

 Anyway, that's all there is to it for the time being, so head over N once
again and you can finally enter...

"Crono, you're so sweet!" -- Marle


 Well, it's actually Leene Square, but anyway, you get the point. In here, you
can play several minigames, which give you Silver Points, which you can trade
for Gold or buy items with 'em. In the first area, if you check the left side,
you'll find your first minigame, in which you have to test your strength by
making the lever hit the bell.

 Press A in front of it and Crono will start going backwards. When he's about
to touch the trees on the S, press A again to have him run forward and hitting
it. If done correctly, you can get 1 Silver Point. In the center of the area,
you have 4 persons in tents. The one in the pink tent sells you items. The one
in the blue tent sells you armor, so I recommend buying yourself a Bronze Helm
and a Padded Vest.

 The guy on the right of the blue tent is Melchior, which will come in play
later in the game. He sells you weapons. If you want/can, buy the Bronze Blade
to help yourself out in the next dungeon. If you talk to the guy to the right,
inside the blue tent, you can guess who'll be the next winner. If you do it
correctly, you'll win 20 Silver Points.

 In the large pink tent on the right you'll find the Tent of Horrors. If you
spend 10 Silver Points, you have to guess who's who. If you do so correctly,
you'll win a little stuffed animal [Poyozo Doll] for your room (keep track of
TWO people if you can). For 40 points, the head will bring out a copy of CRONO
and you'll have to mimic his movements (the face will explain what buttons do
what). Complete this challenge to win a Crono doll for your room (it's pretty
cool, you can put it in different poses!).

 Anyway, after that speak to the girl sitting at the fountain and she'll tell
you something about Lucca. Now go up the stairs to the next area.

 In here, you'll see a blonde chick walking around. Try approaching her to bump
into her, having something sparkling fly away. SPEAK TO THE GIRL FIRST, then
pick up the shiny object. Give the pendant to the girl and let her follow you
around. Name her (Default: Marle). Also note that you can visit the Tent of
Horror now and if you pay 80 silver points you can play a third game (you
needed Marle to play this before now). In this game you will have three enemies
charging at you from the dungeon and you'll be given three beanbags. Touching
them will knock the enemies backwards (and doing it enough will knock them BACK
into the dungeon). While all this is going on, Marle will be LOWERED DOWN with
a rope onto a fire on the left side of the screen. You'll have to additionally
hit a blue button on the left to make Marle go back up. The best thing to do is
to start on the FAR RIGHT and hit all the beanbags in order from right to left,
and then the blue light, and repeat. You'll win a CAT (yes, a cat) for your
efforts that you can see back in your house.

 In the center of the area where you found Marle, you can exchange 10 Silver
Points for 50G. Nice. Now go to the left side and speak to the old man.

 He tells you something about his lunch. DO NOT EAT the pink package on the
table. Now talk to the kitty and it'll start following you. Take the kitty to
the right side of the area and give the kitty to the little girl. Now speak to
the man on the right to have a drinking contest. If you win, you'll get 5
Silver Points. Now go NE to the next area, in which you can dance by pressing
any button. Give it a try.

 Return and go to the NW area (from where you found the kitty). You'll find
Gato here. It's a robot that you can fight for some Silver Points. It has 76HP
and only has 2 attacks. It gives you 10XP, 1 TP and the 15 Silver Points. Now
return to the first area of the Fair and speak to Melchior. Once he asks you to
talk to Marle about selling her pendant, say no. Speak to the girl sitting at
the fountain once again and now go N to the next area.

 Try going N and Marle'll want some candy. Don't move until she does.
Afterwards, go N to find Lucca and her father Taban. Watch the longest scene so
far (be sure to pick up the pendant) and you'll now be at...

 "My travels have taken me to the cathedral in the western wood, and there's
something most peculiar about that place." -- Toma


 <Bkstunt> I'll be guiding you through this area, just so you know!

 As soon as you arrive in this new area, you will be jumped by some blue imps.
They are no challenge though, and will fall in one hit so take them out...

 Head out the glade to the left and go up the ladder. Up here you'll fight two
more blue imps. After that go west to find a 'Potion' in a chest, and south to
claim a 'Power Glove' (equip it!). Head down the map now for one more fight
before moving on.

 You'll now be out on the overworld. It sure looks the same... just, without
some building (like the pier). Go talk to the residences and you'll soon
learn that you are in 600 A.D., as well as a rumor about "Queen Leene" and
the fiendlord. There's a market here as well what you can pick up some
equipment if you haven't already as well as an inn if you need it. You can
even buy a man a drink here to hear how he suspects the cathedral to the west
is suspicious.

 You can go check out the cathedral if you wish to hear several weird comments
from the nuns there. You can also go see the bridge to the southern continent,
which is busted up. Once you're done looking around, head to...

 "We were only together for that short time at the fair, but somehow I knew
you'd come for me." -- Marle


 Here, head up and to the right. Now go down. You'll see two sparkly blue
points on the ground. Inspect the top one for a 'Strength Capsule' and the
lower one for a battle with some Roundillo Riders. Head up now to get jumped
from the trees (more imps) and even further up on the right path where the
bushes will rattle starting a fight with some Roundillos. Inspect the rattling
bushes to the left of here to surprise a monster and get a Shelter (note that
you can come back here and get as many shelter's as you want). Explore the
rest of the forest for more fights, but take note of the black box in the
northeast of this area before moving on to the castle.

 At the castle the soldiers will harass you a bit before Queen Lenne comes
over and tells them to stop. From here you can head to the left to check out
the knight's quarters (and rest for free) and from the right you can check
out the kitchen. Here you can order three different meals to eat by sitting in
the upper left chair on the left table. The salad restores MP, the stew
restores HP, and the spiced roast restores both! There's also an 'Ether' in a
chest down here.

 Now go talk to the king. He'll thank you for helping to rescue the queen and
mentions a coral hairpin she lost. Go up the left tower now. Up on the third
floor be sure to check the chest for '100G'. Up on the top floor you can
startle the chancellor and talk to the guards to learn about the chancellors
odd habits and the queen's bodyguard. Be sure to grab the chest up here by the
bed for a 'Bronze Armor' (equip it on Crono ASAP).

 Head up the right tower now. Be sure to check the southern rooms for a chest
with a 'Potion' in it. On the top floor the guard will let you in as the queen
is waiting for you. Be sure to grab the 'Ether' out of the chest here. Now go
and talk to the queen to see a scene. Head back down the tower after that and
you'll run into Lucca, who will explain a thing or two for you.

 Ok, now with Lucca in tow go back through the Guardia Forest. I'd recommend
going through the forest 3-4 times so you can learn some techs with Lucca and
Crono as well as stock up on some Shelters. I'd also recommend going and
picking up a Bronze Helm for Lucca. Now let's head for the cathedral to the
west. Be sure to save and heal up.

 "Lower your guard, and you allow the enemy in!" -- Frog


 In here go and talk to all of the nuns again and you'll see a blue mark
appear on the floor. Go inspect it to make all the nuns come over and change
into their true form! Use your 'Fire Whirl' tech and try to get three of them
in one go. They will also try to cast slow on you. Afterwards Lucca will let
her guard down and be attacked by a fifth Naga, only to be saved by a.. frog!?

 The frog will go on to state that he is out to save the queen, giving you the
choice to follow him or no...

   <Bkstunt> I LOVE Frog, by the way!

 After joining forces with Frog, he will state you need to find the hidden
passage in this room. Go play the organ in the corner to make a door appear in
the wall across the room. Head inside.

 In here you'll fight Diablo's and Vipers. Things don't fall in one hit
anymore so be sure to focus on one at a time to minimize the amount of damage
you take. It's also worth pointing out that Frog has a heal spell. Of course,
try and use it after battles so you can kill enemies faster.

 To the left you'll find two chests with an 'Athenian Water' and a 'Potion'.
Go left and into the second bigger room now. Head up the stairs and into the
first room. You can check the left drawer here to find some "Naga Bromide"
which will summon in some underling enemies who are begging for a Flame Whirl.
After that, check the chests for a 'Maiden's Suit', another 'Potion', and an
'Ether'.

 Head up now and check the chest for a 'Steel Saber', a katana upgrade for
Crono. The room on the left is surrounded by spikes, but you can hit a switch
to the left to lower the spikes. There are human prisoners in here, as well as
a blue sparkle you can inspect for another 'Strength Capsule'! Nice!

 Now go back to the lower level and up the right-side of this room. Enter this
first room and you'll see several enemies eating (who assume you are in a
human disguise). Talk to each of them a few times and wait for a few seconds
as the Diablo enemy will announce his intention to pay the fiendlord's statue
a visit before his shift starts. Follow him as he leaves the room and head to
the northern room. You'll see the king and queen here (obviously disguises),
but the Diablo opens a room to the right. Enter this room to see it filled
with enemies singing the fiendlord's praises. They have quite a song, and to
the north is a statue of the fiendlord (whose name is Magus). You can talk to
the monsters here for a big fight, but be sure to claim the 'Speed Belt' and
the 'Guardian Bangle' from the chests.

 Head back to the previous room now. There's two chests here too with '100G'
and an 'Ether' in them, but you'll have to fight your way out of the room.
After that go back to the lower level and fight your way up the middle of the
room. I'd actually recommend being sure you learn Frog and Chrono's dual-tech
'X-Strike' here, as the enemies are plentiful and there's a save point nearby.

 In the next area, be sure to use a Shelter at the save point and save up.
Go up the central staircase now. Ignore the room above you now (it has spikes
blocking our progress) and go down the right stairs. From here, go north into
a room. After the battle, be sure to hit the switch on the left and you'll see
the spikes lower in the center room. Good, now head up into the northern
hallway and head left. There's a raised area here that looks like something
should be there, but there's only a note here saying there's no entry within.
Be sure to grab the chests here for a 'Panacea' and a 'Potion'.

 From here, go down into the left room. You'll find another switch here you
can hit if you want, but it just spawns more Mad Bats. Head south and up to
the original area, being sure to nab the chest you'll find on the left for a
'Shelter'. Now go save again if you want and go into the central room for a
rather big battle (Fire Whirl!). After that grab the 'Iron Sword' from the
right chest and play the organ to open up a door in the northern hallway. Go
through it to continue. This room is merely a hallway upwards, so fight your
way up and save/heal at the door. Enter the door to see a scene.

 Well, here we are at your very first boss fight! Nice! Let's do it!

 |   Strategy: For this beast I'd recommend continuously using Frog and      |

 |  Have Lucca use Potions if/when you need healing and 'Flamethrower' when  |
 |  you don't need healed. Yakra has a counter-move he'll do where he goes   |
 |  crazy and bounces around the screen, dealing damage to each party        |
 |  member, so be sure to keep your HP above 50 at all times. Keep up the    |

 After the fight Frog will talk with the Queen and we'll have to go back to
the castle (naturally). Grab the chests here for a 'Mid Ether' and... the
chancellor? Well, at least he's safe. With both chests opened, go down and
talk to the queen, where you will automatically be brought back to...

 "I am disgraced. I failed to protect my Queen." -- Frog

 Here the king and queen will unite while Frog proclaims his failure and
leaves the room. Go after him and he'll say his presence here caused the Queen
trouble, then comments that Crono has great potential as a swordsman.

 After seeing Frog leave, go up the right tower and make your way to where you
saw Marle vanish. With the queen's safety assured, Marle will reappear, saying
that she was in a cold void (experiencing "death" perhaps) and Lucca will tell
her that she knows who she really is. Marle will tell you she hid it from you
at the fair as she didn't think you'd be nice to her if you knew, giving you
a choice of answers. Of course you'll want to answer with the second answer
to make Marle happy.

 With your party full again, go back and head through the Guardia Forest to
get out to the overworld. Here you can buy Marle a better helm (she could use
it) as well as go talk to the bridge guard who will tell you that Frog swam
across to the southern continent. From here, go back to the canyon area that
you started off in and make your way to the area you entered this time period
from. Note that there are two new enemies in this area now: the fiendillo and
the imp hawk (you may have to enter the canyon from the left to find the imp
hawk, just so you know). Once you are in the area you started in, Lucca will
show you her secret: a time gate! She studied her teleporter and made a gate
key, which can HOLD OPEN a time gate, allowing us to go back to our own time!
Go ahead and head back.

"What shall be his fate? To burn at the stake, perhaps?
                       To feel the Tickler, or hang upside down?" -- Chancellor


   <vin> Man, I'm back. I'll walk you from here through the Present up to the
   next era. ;)

 Ok, as soon as we get back to 1000AD's Millennial Fair, Lucca separates from
Crono and Marle, leaving you to explore once again. There's nothing new at the
Fair, only that the merchants left it already and are at Truce's Market. They
sell the same things, so meh. You can still play the minigames at the Fair
though.

 Anyway, make your way to Guardia Forest, get through it, level up if so
desired and enter Guardia's Castle only to get taken to your Trial to pay for
your "sins"...

   <vin> Man, it always sends a chill down my spine, that Trial part.

 Here, we get judged by what we did at the Millennium Fair. There are several
things that make you innocent, others that make you guilty. Here's a little
list/chart with 'em all.

"So, what do you think of my disposable Zonker-38? Pretty cool, huh?" -- Lucca


 Ok, we're now sentenced to death, whether we WERE guilty or not. Either way,
we're taken to our cell. In here, there's a save point, a pink package and a
mug that restores your HP and MP. In the package, you'll find Ethers and the
amount you receive depends on the number of jurors who voted "Not Guilty" for
you. Here's the amounts:
         _____________________________________________________________
        |=============.=====.=====.=====.=====.=====.=====.=====.=====|
        | # of Ethers |  6  |  3  |  2  |  1  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |
        |-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
        | # of Jurors |  7  |  6  |  5  |  4  |  3  |  2  |  1  |  0  |
        |_____________'_____'_____'_____'_____'_____'_____'_____'_____|
        '============================================================='

 As you can see, if you get all the jurors on your side, you get 6 'Ethers'.
Nicely done. Right here, we have of 2 soups, we can either break our of our
cell and fight through the whole Prison Towers alone, or we can wait for the 3
days until Execution to pass to be taken to the guillotine and have Lucca
rescue us there. I recommend doing the later.

 Anyway, after the scene where Lucca rescues you, and when you regain control,
open the chest in the room to find 'Bronze Armor'. Leave the room and open the
chest to find 'Mid-Potion'. Now release the prisoner here to meet Fritz. More
about Fritz later...

   <vin> Man, just how the hell did Fritz just walked out of the Prison Towers
   unharmed? o_O That still remains unknown to me =P.

 Now leave the room and examine the body of the soldier that's just outside the
gate to find a 'Mid-Potion'. If you approach the soldier on the left unnoticed,
you'll get another 'Mid-Potion'...

   <vin> You can pretty much cheese-ball your inventory here by sneaking up on
   the soldiers and getting a Mid-Potion each time. You can do this until you
   max 'em out, so do so if so desired.

 Anyway, from the fork in this room, go W and you'll be outside, crossing a
large bridge. You get attacked by 2 Royal Guards. Easy peasy. Anyway, keep
going W to the next room. We'll be in a 4-way fork, with a pair of Sentries in
the center. To take these out, wait for them to remove the shield from their
"face", then attack 'em, otherwise, you won't deal any dmg.

 Once taken care of, go NW and you'll find 2 cells. The first one has a
skeleton enemy called Lancer. Dispose of him and the other cell is impossible
to open, so return to the previous fork. Go SW from here and you'll be where
Crono was held. You can still use your mug to refill your HP and MP, so do so,
return to the fork and go SE.

 Cross the bridge here and in this room, sneak up on the Royal Guard, open the
gate and go inside. In here, you'll find 'Ether', 'Ether', 'Mid-Potion' and
'Mid-Potion'. Try returning to the previous fork and we'll have to fight
Gaoler. He nullifies all magic and skills, so use only physical attacks.

 Anyway, once you return to the fork, go NE from whence you once came and in
this room, sneak up on the Royal Guard once again (*hinthint) and go N from the
fork. Sneak up on another guard as you move out and when you reach another 4-
way fork, go SW first and open the chest in the first cell to find 'Shelter'.
If you speak to the prisoner on the other cell, it turns into a skeleton.

   <vin> Creepy, I know O_O

 Return to the fork and go NW this time. There's nothing in the first cell, so
go in the second one and go outside the tower. Descend the tower and enter the
bottom cell. You'll find a chest here with 'Shelter'. Go down the hole in this
room and you'll find another 2 chests with 'Silver Sword' and '1,500G'. Equip
that sword on Crono ASAP, return to the 4-way fork and follow the NE path this
time.

 We reach the entrance and there's a save point. Be sure to check the document
lying on the ground, as it explains the Dragon Tank we are about to see. Also,
be sure to check the man here to get FIVE 'Mid-Potions'! Wow!

   <bk> Check the man again to hear a HILARIOUS quote from Lucca!

 Use a Shelter, save your game, and proceed. A little scene triggers, as well
as a...

 |                                                                           |
 |   Strategy: Ok, this battle is easy if you know what to do and what each  |
 |  part does and how to counter it or it can be really hard if you have no  |
 |  idea what's going on. First of all, let me explain this:                 |
 |                                                                           |
 |  HEAD: This part of the tank heals up the other parts of the tank.        |
 |  WHEEL: This has the most powerful attack which attacks both Lucca and    |
 |         Crono.                                                            |
 |  BODY: Has a regular attack and has a counter if attacked physically.     |
 |                                                                           |
 |   As you can see, the very first thing to aim for is the Head. If you     |
 |  attack any other part, the head will just heal it when its turn comes.   |
 |  So the head has to go down first. Once you've done so, aim for the       |
 |  wheel. Like I just said, the wheel has an attack where it dmgs. both     |
 |  characters, so that's a must kill.                                       |
 |                                                                           |
 |   Once they're both down, just take your time to take down the body.      |
 |  Each time you attack, the body will counter, so make sure Lucca keeps    |
 |  healing Crono with Potions. Use Mid-Potions if you seriously need to.    |
 |  If Lucca doesn't need to heal, have her attack the body along with       |
 |  Crono. Like I said, once you know what part does what, it's a really     |
 |  easy boss.                                                               |
 |                                                                           |
 +===========================================================================+

 After the fight, watch how the bridge is repaired (LOL), cross it and in the
first room of the tower, open up the chest for a 'Shelter'. Now go down and go
to the entrance of the castle, where Marle appears and joins you once again.
Once the party runs into the Forest, go E to trigger a little scene where
you'll find another Gate, which takes you to...

"Kingdom? Chancellor? Has the hunger driven you mad?" -- Trann Dome Resident


 <Bkstunt> Hey, I'm back! Did you guys miss me?

 Well, we've escaped the chancellor at least, but where exactly are we?
Wherever we are, the civilization seems advanced. Note that you can use the
gate here to go BACK to the PRESENT, but you'll just end up getting chased
back into it again.

 The door to your north is magically sealed, so head down the stairs to the
south. You'll end up in the overworld. It sure looks... kinda post-apocolyptic
doesn't it? The dome he just came out of is "Bangor Dome". To the south is
another dome called "Trann Dome" that has a few human survivors, including a
shop (tell the first man you have money) and a "inn" of sorts (the
"Enertron"). I'd recommend picking up the weapon for Lucca and, if you can
afford it, helm and armor upgrades for everyone!

 After that, head up into "Site 16", the northern city area. This area is
basically a dump. The rats around here aren't really enemies, but if you
bump into them they will STEAL one of your potions, so avoid them at all
costs! The big flower-looking things here are enemies, so from the entrance
head up a bit and right to fight one. Note that the flowers have a heal-all
move so take it out first. After this first fight, find the chest on the
right to claim a 'Berserker Ring'. This handy item puts Auto-Berserk AND
Auto-Protect on a single character, boosting their ATK and DEF, but taking
away direct control. It's not a bad item to give Crono now, to be honest.

 Head up now avoiding the rats and fighting the obvious enemies. You'll have
to go right soon, but keep you eyes peeled for a chest with a 'Silver Sword'
in it. Head up again after that avoiding the rats (they run in certain
patterns, if that helps). At the top head left but grab the 'Silver Bow' out
of the upper left cubby before you head down into another battle. Head up
after that and fight your way to the screen's exit on the right.

 Here notice the blue puddles to the right. These things are enemies called
"Shadow". These guys are immune to physical attacks, but will fall to
elemental attacks like flamethrower. Try to hit them with the 'Flame Whirl'
if you can. The big purple monsters lying on the rubble are also enemies. Go
check the SW corner of this area for an 'Ether'. After that, head to the NE
corner to find the exit back to the overworld.

"Ironic, is it not? We starve right atop our own stores of food." -- Doan


 Ah, back to the overworld. Ok, out here we have three places we can do to:
the nearest dome (Arris Dome), the furthest dome (Abandoned Sewers), or some
ruins north of the domes (Site 32). Let's go head into the Arris Dome first.

 Make your way to the back of this place where a resident will ask where you
came from. Upon hearing you passed through Site 16, everyone will perk up and
pay attention. Go ahead and talk to them to learn all sorts of interesting
things, especially of the food shortage (imagine, living RIGHT ABOVE your
stash of food and STARVING!) and Death Peak where the residents state the
source of all this devastation started!

 There's a shop and a save point to the left here, as well as an Enertron.
Well, we can't just let these people starve can we? Of course we can't! Go
ahead and head down the ladder.

 Down here, go inspect the monitors to see that they control the door lock,
but require a password. Well, we don't have one, so head up the ladder on the
left. You'll be up in the rafters now. Continue on until you see a weird rat
thing on the right. Inspect it to see that it appears to be a statue with a
note stating you'll be attacked if you approach the food stocks. Fun. Keep
heading to the north section of the rafters to find one that takes you north
into a room. In here, head north and try to go through the door to meet...

 |                                                                           |
 |   Well, as you can see, we have the BIG Guardian machine at the top, and  |
 |  two Pods to the left and right. Now, despite the fact that the game      |
 |  lists the same counters for each enemy, the only counter you REALLY have |
 |  to worry about is Delta Attack. This one happens if you attack the       |
 |  Guardian when BOTH Pods are alive, so whatever you do, don't do that!    |
 |                                                                           |
 |   Focus on killing off the Pods first (they don't counter on their own),  |
 |  then unleash on the Guardian. With both Pods dead, the Guardian's sole   |
 |  purpose in life is to revive them, and will count down from 5 to 0. Once |
 |  it hits 0, both Pods will revive. Since it does this, you are going to   |
 |  want to stop attacking the Guardian at "1" to avoid accidentally         |
 |  triggering Delta Attack. Have Marle heal anyone that gets low on health  |
 |  you'll be fine.                                                          |
 |                                                                           |
 +===========================================================================+

 Go inside the room afterwards to reach the food store, where you'll find that
the poor people up above are out of luck. Marle will inspect the man at the
end to find a key item: the 'Seed'. Go re-check the man again to find a note
that states the rat we saw earlier is more than just a statue and knows the
secret of this dome! Cool! Be sure to grab the 'Mid-Ether' in the chest to the
left and head back to the rafter room.

 In here, you'll see the rat off to left. Marle will point him out and tell
you to run after him. What you need to do here is just run after the rat as
fast as you can (you are slightly faster than it) and press 'A' when you get
near him. The rat runs all the way to the beginning of this area, so you'll
have to move fast! Don't worry if you don't catch him the first time, you
can just re-enter this area and try again. Once you catch the rat, it will
tell you that to operate the console below, just hold 'L' and 'R' together
and press 'A' in front of the console.

 Go down and try it out. You can do it to both consoles, but you obviously
need to do it to the right console to continue. Head through the right door
to continue. You'll run into some new enemies here (the rat and exterminator).
It's cool how the exterminator kills the rats for you! Stay on the lower-level
here and grab the 'Mid-Ether' from the chest. Now get on the left catwalk and
head up to the north. Here you'll have to head south on the lower level, so
fight your way through the bugs to get on the right catwalk which leads to the
door.

 This next room is quite large, but there's not all that much to say about it.
You'll fight some shadow's, rats and exterminators, and a new robot-type enemy
called "Version 2.0". Up at the top of the room you can interact with a
console that leads to a sealed door...

   <Bkstunt> It's the same combination of buttons; R + L + A.

 ... or take the left catwalk to reach a new door. This new room contains a
supercomputer, which Lucca will be ALL OVER. She will run a scan for time gates
and find one east of here in a place called "Proto Dome". Marle will then push
a button that show's you QUITE a revealing video... 1999AD, the "Day of Lavos".

 Marle will then dictate our whole goal in life: to prevent THIS future from
happening. Go ahead and answer however you want: you're doing it regardless!

 <Bkstunt> Who would say 'No!' here!?

 With the theme song blasting away, go ahead and go back up to the resident's
living quarters. Upon getting there, you'll see a scene with Doan, who will
eventually give you a 'Jetbike Key'. Note that you'll lose your seed here, as
you're giving it to Doan. Be sure to heal up and than head out to the
overworld.

"Schala... Oh, I've missed you so!" -- Old Man


 Ok, back out on the world map, we have 2 choices: Site 32 or the Abandoned
Sewers. Let's go explore the sewers!

 Once you head down into the sewer, you'll be spotted by a creature who will
run off to report you as intruders. Yikes! Oh well... Head to the right first.
The little balls here are an enemy (an "Egg Ooze"), so defeat them along with
the water monster that shows up (a "Dondrago") to claim the '600G' they are
protecting. Head to the left now where you'll fight two more Dondrago's. After
that you'll see two minions arguing about a non-existent bridge to the south
before running away. Go ahead and follow the minions downwards.

 Down here head over to the left area. You'll find a diary page here that
basically says the fishmen attack whenever you make a sound! This is basically
a hint for the upcoming path: if you DON'T want to fight a series of dondragos
you are going to have to be QUIET. This includes not touching:

  1. The Cat
  2. The Soda Can
  3. The Cheese
  4. The Save Point

 So choose to avoid them or not, it's up to you (extra XP never hurts!). At
the end of this area climb up the ladder to get in another fight. Head up the
north path now and press against the right-hand wall to enter the obvious path
east-ward path between the wall. Here you can find a switch on the northern
wall here that opens the door to the right. Go back and head further up now
to get around and through the door you just opened. Head through it and you'll
see the minions talking about the switch to the south. Kind of them to point
stuff out for us, huh?

 Head north to find a 'Rage Band' in the chest up here. This handy items will
grant you a 50% counter-attack rate. Not too shabby! Go ahead and make sure
you have 100+ HP here, and then head to the right to run into...

 +===========================================================================+

 After the fight, heal up anyone who's close to dying and head south. You'll
have to fight a battle in the open area, then you can head further south. Go
past the ladder here and check out the treasure chest for a 'Thunder Blade'.
You can also hit the button here the minions were checking out earlier to make
the bridges pop up for us (there's one right to our left, and the one near
where we FIRST saw the minions). Go back and up the ladder to get back to the
world map.

 Out here, there are two places you can go visit. To your right is Death Peak,
and to your south is the Keeper's Dome. Let's head into Death Peak first.

 This area is VERY windy. Go ahead, try and run forwards. You'll soon find out
that the wind is SO strong, you get blown right out of this area. Go back and
run forward, but cut to the right and aim for the sparkling-blue shine near
the wall to get a 'Strength Capsule'.

 After that, go check out the Keeper's Dome. You can meet the old man here
who seems to ramble non-sense, and check out his "Strange Construct". There's
also another mysterious black door here, but we can't do much with it now.
Once you're done exploring, go ahead and head back through the sewers and back
to the world map area near Site 32, which is going to be our next area.

"I'll let you use that jetbike, 'cause that's the kinda guy I am." -- Johnny


 Go ahead and Site 32 now. Be sure to grab the 'Mid-Potion' from the chest to
the right, then head up to the jetbike. Interact with it to see a scene and
meet Johnny. He'll say that you have to race him across the ruined highway,
and will ask if you know how to ride. Go ahead and say 'No' to have Johnny
explain how to race to you:


   Controls:

   D-Pad: Steer the bike up and down.
       B: Use a turbo boost (Mode 1 Only).
       A: Zoom In
       X: Zoom Out
   Start: Pause
   L & R: Rotate Camera (Mode 2 Only).


 I'm sure you noticed the Mode 1 and 2 thing up there, right? That's because
you can actually WALK the length of the highway instead of racing over it.
There's a key item along the way though, so we're going to walk it anyway just
to pick that up! Make sure you're healed up before you do this though, as
you'll meet Mutants and Shadows along the way. Keep your eyes open along the
southern portion of this area to spot a chest with a 'Race Recorder' in it.

 Once you have this item you can go back to Johnny and a robot named Rx-xR
will show up and offer to record your race times against Johnny. He'll also
offer a "Mode 2" to race. The only differences between Mode 1 and Mode 2 are
that Mode 2 doesn't have boosts and let's you freely rotate the camera.

 Either way, we need to race and beat Johnny. Beating Johnny is actually a
very easy thing. Let's go over how the race goes first though.

 Basically, the speed you travel at is automatic. The game will INCREASE and
DECREASE your speed CONSTANTLY (like a sine wave), and the only thing you can
really control is if you go up or down. The game will also show you the length
of the track on the bottom, so you can keep track of your progress. The bottom
also shows how many boosts you have left. You'll also see that there's some
numbers in the upper left. "Left" always starts out at 1000 and counts down,
showing you how far you have left to go. "PTS." is your score. It works like
this: every time you are in FRONT of Johnny, the points go UP. Every time you
are behind him, the points go DOWN.

 To win easily, just be SURE to use a BOOST right before the finish line. As
long as you do, you'll win every time. Also, with the race recorder in hand,
Rx-xR will record your top 3 SCORES. This is important because you can win
prizes based upon your score:

   .---------.-------------------.
   |  Score  |        Prize      |
   |---------+-------------------|
   |   777   |  10 Mid-Ethers    |
   |  1300+  |  5 Mid-Potions    |
   |  1500+  |  Strength Capsule |
   |  2000+  |  5 Ethers         |
   |  2300+  |  5 Hi-Ethers      |
   '---------'-------------------'

 Personally, I find racing in Mode 2 to be MUCH easier. I swing the camera so
the racers are facing ME, and then do my best to not let Johnny pass me. In
order to get the higher scores (1500+), you're going to have to get GOOD at
not letting Johnny pass you!


 Anyways, once you've had your fun here head out to the world map to continue.

"It's in bad shape... but it looks like a humanoid robo! Incredible!" -- Lucca


 Ok, out here head to the right. You'll find the "Derelict Factory" to the
right and the "Proto Dome" to the south. Let's go check out the Proto Dome
first.

 In here you'll have to fight some robots right off the bat. Head up and
fight another set of robots then use the Enertron nearby. Now head around the
right to the north area. Looks like a robot is broken down up ahead. Go ahead
and examine it to see a scene.

 Alright, another party member! Robo joins us at level 10 and has a rocket
punch tech as well as a healing beam. Robo will let us know that the Proto
Dome is powered down, but the Derelict Factory up north has a generator we
can use. You'll have to pick either Lucca or Marle to leave behind though.
I'm going to take Marle for her healing ability, but you can take whomever.

 Head back up to the world map, save if you wish, and enter the Derelict
Factory. In here go inspect the monitor and Robo will disable the security
system. You'll have to fight an Acid afterwards though. Go up on the right
conveyor belt and fight some new robots called Deverminators. You can read
a note on the wall afterwards that will tell you that the path on the left
is the laboratory and the path on the right is the factory. Let's take the
right path first.

 You'll be led down into a big conveyor room. Head down the first ladder here
and head left. Take the ladder leading up into the open door here and head up.
You'll be off-screen at this point, but head up and right and hit A to open a
chest with a 'Mid-Ether'. Now exit this room and head down to the lower left
ladder. This leads down to the ground floor, but you can head left here to
find another chest with a 'Bandit Bow' in it.

 Head back up the ladder you used to get down here and go down the ladder to
the right. This leads to a room that lets you get ON the conveyor belt, but
you can only head LEFT. If you happen to touch any robots along the way, a
crane arm will come down and grab you, dropping you off on another belt that
will force you into a series of battle against various robots. After the
battles you'll get dropped off to where we want to go though, but I'm going
to take the conveyor belt path. Just be sure to run when there's no robots
coming and utilize the little areas to the south when you have to. In fact,
one of them has a chest with a 'Ether' in it. Keep going until you reach the
last southern section, where you can find a door to the south.

 Here kill the bugs and head up the ladder to another door. This leads to the
catwalks above the previous room. Head up here and check the right area for a
chest with a 'Mid-Potion'. Go into the door here now and check out the screen
on the wall for the following:

   Crane Control Codes:

   Pattern 00: X A

   Pattern 01: B B

 Well, it looks like we're going to get to play with the crane. Afterwards the
robots on the wall will be released and run around like crazy (these are
version 3.0 robots!). Be sure to grab the chests here for '400 Gold' and a
'Mid-Ether'. Head back out now and go left. Enter the door here for another
robot battle, then be sure to grab the chests here for a 'Shelter' and a
'Ether'. Enter the left room afterwards.

 You'll be at the crane controls now. The game will explain to you how to
operate the crane, so after the light flashes and you hear the tone, input the
codes above. After you've done both of them, the orange cans will finally be
out of the way. Head back to the catwalk now and take the far-left ladder.
Head to the left now and enter the door there. You'll find a 'Thunder Blade'
in the chest here. Also check out the monitor here for another code:

   Zabie Code: X A B Y

 Well, this will undoubtedly come in handy. With that knowledge in hand, go
back to the lift and take it back up to the factory entrance. Now head down
the left lift. You'll find a SAVE POINT here, so go ahead and use it. Also,
note that the lift we just used can go down TWICE more, but both areas are
blocked off by lasers so we're better off ignoring that fact. From the save
point head up through the left door. You'll fight some more acid creatures
here (Use "Wind Slash") and then examine the monitor here to open a hatch
leading further down. Be sure to open the chest here for a 'Shelter' before
heading down.

 Down here head left and fight the occasional acid enemy. There's a door here
on the lower left leading south. Follow the path to the next door (you'll see
a laser blocking your path rightwards). Head up now and grab the 'Hammer Arm'
our of the chest. Now inspect the monitor here and Robo will deactivate all of
the defense lasers! Yes! You'll now have to fight FIVE acid enemies ( Use Wind
Slash!). Afterwards, go grab the chest on the left for a 'Titanium Vest'. Now
either use the lift or the ladder below the chest to get further down.

 Here, head up and get the 'Plasma Gun' from the chest. Now inspect the
monitor here and it will ask you for the "Zabie Code". Go ahead and input the
code to open up the door (it's up above!). Head up and interact with the
central structure here to make some alarms sound. Looks like we've activated
the security system. Robo will tell us we have to leave immediately!

 Head down and watch the scene. We can't leave via elevator as it's disabled,
so head up the ladder on the left. Be sure to heal up about now (use Robo's
healing skills to do it). Head counter-clockwise here until you run into
another scene. Oh, how sad! You can't even do anything about it! :(
Afterwards, you'll have to fight:

 |   You'll be fighting SIX Robo look-a-likes here, and with only two party  |
 |  members! Jeez! Well, since the robots are lined up in two rows, the BEST |
 |  attack to use here is Crono's "Cyclone" attack. HOWEVER, be careful of   |
 |  using it when the robots are in their running animation due to their     |
 |  counter (I had THREE of them use Robo Pitch on me! OUCH!).               |

 |   Be sure to have Marle keep your HP up, as the robots can pile on the    |
 |  damage in a hurry (those 20HP hits add up!). Between her healing and     |

 +===========================================================================+

 After the fight, you'll end up dragging Robo back to Lucca in the Proto Dome.
Lucca will take some time to work on Robo and get him back into shape. Go
ahead and watch the scene to see Robo's decision. In the morning the entire
party will go through the gate together, leading to...

 Ok, as we arrive at an unknown destination, go right and you'll see a man
sleeping under a light pole. Speak to him and a little chat starts. Once it's
over, when you get to pick your character to be left behind, I recommend
leaving Robo for the time being. He also tells you that you can use the pillars
of light from where you appeared to get back to previous gates. Nice.

 As you try to leave, he tells you to go inside the door behind him. Do so and
speak to the character here. His form varies by the level you are. He can be a
monkey-like enemy (which looks awfully like the Mankey Pokemon) or a little
green one. Mmmm, anyway, he introduces himself as Spekkio. He teaches you how
to use magic.

 But to do so, you need to run around the room clockwise while sticking to the
wall 3 times and then you learn the magic. Also, each of your characters has a
different affinity:

 o Crono: Light
 o Marle: Water/Ice
 o Lucca: Fire

 Robo doesn't have magic since he's a robot >_>. Now he tells you if you wanna
test out your newly acquired magic. Say yes and you'll fight him. He has 800HP,
so use your magic over and over until you defeat him, without worrying about
healing. You'll receive 'Magic Capsule' and 'Ether x5' as your reward. Now
leave the room and move over to the magic pillars.

 Check them out and use the upper light pillar to reach...

 We arrive at Medina Village, a village of pure monsters. After coming out of
the closet [=P], leave the house here and enter the Elder's House. Check the
kitchen white counter to find a secret 'Speed Capsule'. Now go upstairs and
check the SW corner (Where the wood is) to find 'Magic Capsule'. You can check
out the Market and Inn if you want, but you have to fight for the right to use
them and they are overpriced anyways. Leave the Elder's house and head NE to
the blue pyramid, the Forest Ruins.

 Open up the lone chest on the left to find 'Mid-Ether'. Now leave the area and
go SW to find Melchior's Cabin. Speak to him to buy some weapons. Buy a Crimson
Blade for Crono...

   <vin> Equip that Plasma Gun on Lucca, the one you found at Derelict Factory
   if you didn't have her in your team.

 Also, buy Titanium Vests for the characters that require it. Also make sure to
buy many Mid-Potions. They'll come in handy against the next boss. Now leave
the Cabin and go into the...

 As you enter the cave, you'll be greeted by 2 Underlings. No problem. Kill
them and proceed deeper into the cave. Go down the rope ladder when you get to
it, grab 'Ether' from the chest on the right and descend another rope ladder.
Down here, you'll be greeted by a Djinn Bottle, which spits out 3 Cave
Stalkers.

 The Djinn isn't tough, but the Cave Stalker can blind your characters, which
is more the reason to use your newly acquired magic spells. You can also check
out Lucca and Marle's Dual Tech Antipode Bomb. Now proceed S to the next room.
Down here is the main room, and it's filled with rivers and several passages.

 Go down the stairs and you'll get in a fight with 2 Rhino Weevil. These are
very strong against physical attacks, so make sure you use magic against them.
From here, there are 2 paths. Follow the SW one and go in the room. You'll have
to fight 3 Boundillos. Not hard at all, just physically attack them. Now go
left and now you'll have to fight 3 Cave Bats. Dammit. Use magic on the Cave
Bats too if you want to avoid a longer fight. Wind Slash works wonders here.

 Now open the chest to find 'Magic Scarf'. Equip it on Marle or Lucca ASAP and
return to the previous room. Now go W from the part where you killed the Rhino
Weevil and open the chest to find 'Mid-Ether'. Continue on and you'll now be in
a fight with 4 Rhino Weevil. Not hard. Before going S, go N and open the chest
to find 'Ether'. Now go S and into the room.

 Another fight with Boundillos triggers here. Mmm. Once you're done, go left,
kill the Cave Bats and go into the room. Kill the Djinn Bottle in this room,
check out the black box that can't be opened at the moment and exit to the
right (use the map to locate the exit). Back in this room, go down into the
water, go right and N under the paths and up the stairs.

 Shelter yourself, save your game and go N inside the next room to trigger a...

 |   Strategy: Ok, this Heckran can be tough, really tough if you have no    |
 |  clue what you're doing. First lets go over his attacks. Water deals      |
 |  around 40 dmg. Nereid Cyclone deals around 80 dmg. Yah! deals around 70  |
 |  dmg. Counter Water II deals around 100 dmg. to all.                      |

 |   The best course of action you can take is to have Crono use Lightning   |
 |  while Lucca and Marle use their Antipode Bomb to deal some massive dmg.  |
 |  Each time Heckran uses Nereid Cyclone, have Crono use a Mid-Potion on    |
 |  that character. Crono will be your designated healer in this fight, so   |
 |  Lucca and Marle can get rid of him ASAP.                                 |
 |                                                                           |
 |   When he says "Go ahead, try and attack! See what it gets you!", DO NOT  |
 |  ATTACK Heckran. If you attack him, he'll counter you with Water II on    |
 |  all, which can be devastating. When it says "Counterattack stance        |
 |  disengaged.",  you can finally keep pawning his ass. That's all there is |
 |  to it, really. Keep up the Antipode Bombs and Crono's Mid-Potions and    |
 |  you'll be victorious.                                                    |
 |                                                                           |
 +===========================================================================+

 Watch the little chat after the fight and use the water vortex to return to
Lucca's place. Go inside her house, go inside the room and up the stairs to the
right. You'll see something between Taban and Lara. Once Taban leaves, go to
the first room and speak to him to receive 'Taban's Vest'. Equip it on Lucca
ASAP and leave her place. Now go to the Market and speak to Fritz to receive
'Mid-Ether x10' for saving his ass. Nice =D.

 He sells the same things as Melchior, so meh. Now go to Crono's house and
speak with mom and cats. Rest if you want to, leave and go to the Millennial
Fair. Go to the gate to the N and use it to go to the End of Time. You'll see
that 2 more Light portals appeared, the one for Leene Square and the one at
Truce Canyon at 600AD. Lets go get 2 more Light portals. Return to Leene Square
at 1000AD and go to Guardia Forest.

 Remember the gate the party used to flee from the Chancellor? Use that gate
and back at the End of Time, you'll have 2 more Light Portals, the one for
Guardia Forest and the one for Bangor Dome. Nice. Now heal up, save your game,
change characters if you want and now use the Light Portal to 600AD Truce
Canyon (its the top-left one).

"Lord Crono! The great Hero has appeared, from the very pages of legend!"
                                                              -- The Chancellor

 <Bkstunt> I'm back again, let's get medieval!


 With all this talk about Magus summoning forth Lavos, Crono and crew decide
that the easiest solution is to take out Magus. Makes sense. After taking the
portal to 600 A.D., head out through Truce Canyon to the World Map.

 Out here you can check out the residences and shops to learn that the king
was wounded in battle as the fiendlord's forces draw near Zenan Bridge, but
that's ok since the Legendary Hero has appeared! You can check out the Castle
too if you want but we're going to go there in a bit so south to Zenan Bridge.

 At the front lines, talk to the commander to hear of their dire need for food
supplies. After that head north and head into the Castle. In here you can go
visit the king, but what we really want is to go visit the kitchen. Talk to
the head chef here about the troops food situation and he'll start to argue
with his wife! Ha! He won't give you anything though, but once you start to
leave the Castle he'll quickly rush up to you and give you some 'Spiced Jerky'
along with a 'Strength Capsule' for helping you.

 Head back to Zenan bridge and give the food to the commander. He'll thank
you. You can talk to the other knights here to learn that the Hero made it
across the bridge, but they've suffered heavy losses. Talk to the commander
again to agree to lend your blade to the fight. He'll give you a 'Golden Helm'
for helping them. Equip it on Crono and head down the bridge. You'll see some
knights fall to a couple of skeletons and one of Magus's generals, Ozzie, will
introduce himself before sicking the skeletons on you.

 Take down the skeleton's with magic and attack Ozzie a few times until he
runs off. Pshaw! I'd like to point out here that Ozzie is technically listed
in the bestiary as a "Boss", but one attack here will make him run (despite
how many HP they say he has in the bestiary... Who knows, he may show up later
though. Chase after him and he'll turn three fallen knights into skeletons for
round two! Take them out with magic as well and attack Ozzie again to make him
flee. Heal up after this fight and chase him again for...

 |   Strategy: We have two targets in this battle: the upper and lower       |
 |  halves of Zombor. Now, despite what the bestiary says each half has      |
 |  their own counter that they WILL do once they die. So the real question  |
 |  is, do you want to get hit by MP Buster or Annihilation ray first?       |
 |                                                                           |
 |   Well, you can win either way, but I like to take out the Upper Body     |
 |  first. This may seem odd since MP Buster puts one characters MP to 0     |
 |  when it goes off, but the top half can do Annihilation Ray at ANY time.  |
 |  So with that in mind, have Marle cast Ice on the top half EVERY round.   |
 |  Crono can attack normally while Lucca's job is to use a mid-potion on    |
 |  anyone that needs it (you probably won't even need to unless it gets in  |
 |  an Annihilation Ray attack.                                              |
 |                                                                           |
 |   After taking out the top half, one unfortunate soul will loose all of   |
 |  his or her MP. That's ok though, the bottom half's attacks are all       |
 |  pretty sad. Try to keep track of it's HP so you can make sure you're all |
 |  healed up in preparation for Annihilation Ray when you defeat it!        |
 |                                                                           |

"I am no Hero. There's naught I can do to help." -- Frog


 Down here you can visit the nearby market and stock up on potions if you
wish, but be sure to visit the northern residence. In here you can check out
the chest glowing with a blue light. It's locked, but after that you can talk
to the man on the left who will notice you are carrying around some "Naga
Bromide" (the item that we found in Manolia Cathedral several chapters earlier
that isn't listed as an item in our menu). Agree to give it to him and he'll
unlock the drawer for you in return. Check it again for a 'Magic Capsule'.

 Afterwards be sure to visit the inn. You can find out a LOT of helpful
information here, so be sure to talk to everyone. You'll also undoubtedly want
to stay a night since SOMEONE has no MP. Go ahead and stay a night. If you
don't have an "Ambrosia" in your inventory you'll get one as a gift for
staying the night! Cool!

 Next be sure to visit the elder's house as well. As soon as you enter you'll
hear the elder giving a side-quest to a famous explorer named Toma to recover
a rainbow shell. Toma will take his advance and leave to the Inn to go down a
cold one before setting out. You can follow him and learn of a "monstrous
frog" that lives south in the cursed woods. From Dorino village you can find
the Denadoro Mountains to the east (we'll head there in a bit) and the Magic
Cave to the south-east from there.

 For now, head south and visit Fiona's Villa. Her husband, Marco, hasn't
returned from the war but she is guarding the forest around her. Aww, how
nice. You can take two 'Mid-Ethers' from the chests here. Head further south
to the village of Porre. Down here be sure to visit the Market (south of the
Inn) to find a blue sparkle to your left.  You can get a 'Strength Capsule'
here! There are some armor upgrades you can buy here as well if you wish,
or you could save your money for another cause (read the next paragraph before
deciding). Further south you can visit the tavern to once again meet Toma
(who says that he's tracked down the rainbow shell to an island, but he
doesn't know which one). You can also learn the secret of the Magic Cave from
an older man standing in the corner here. More importantly, you can learn of
that the Legendary Hero is Tata!

 Tata's house is to the left of the Tavern, but he isn't home right now. You
can also visit the Elder's House on the left if you wish. The wife here will
want Spicy Jerky, which you can get from the Snail Shop in present day Porre,
remember? It costs you $9,900 though, so it's PRETTY pricey. You can probably
swing it though, so go pick it up now if you want. It's a bit of a trip of
course (you have to go back to 1000 AD Porre after all), but once you bring
it back to the wife she will ask if she can buy it from you for $10,000. Now
you COULD make a $100 profit, but that's chump change! Let here have it for
free and you will REALLY strike a chord with her. She will promise to teach
her children to be generous.

 So what's the do exactly? Well, remember during the beginning of the game
how the mayor of Porre would pay you to make fun of yourself? Well now he is
a very kind and generous man thanks to what you just did! This will come into
play later during the game too...

 We have ONE more goal in this section. To the northwest of Porre is the Cursed
Woods. Go ahead and enter. Here you'll find a bunch of frogs you can fight
that are accompanied by snakes! Note that you can HURT the snake here and it
will actually EAT (kill) the frogs (well I guess that's why their names are
"Edible Frogs!"). Make your way through this screen killing the frogs and
snakes while nabbing the two chests on the right for a 'Mid-Potion' and a
'Shelter'. At the top of this area you'll see a bush out in the open shake
from time to time. Well, you can walk behind the bush and INTO it to crawl
down into a grotto.

 <Bkstunt> You can find the enemy "Nu" here, slightly north of the frog
between the top trees. It's rare to see him out here and we will encounter
them later in the game so don't worry about finding one for now.

 Down here check the pot on the right for a 'Magic Scarf'. Now head towards
the bed to meet your old friend Frog! Crono will tell Frog about the King and
the trouble the kingdom is having... but Frog will walk away in though before
telling you that he is no hero and cannot help you. No matter what you do here
Frog will repeat his sentiments...

 Well, without Frog we better go search for the Legendary Hero Tata up north
at the Denadoro Mountains. Be sure to heal up and save before moving on.

"Even had I the blade, I've no right to wield it." -- Frog


 <Bkstunt> Hey guys, I recommend Crono, Marle, and Lucca here. Lucca's fire
is EXTREMELY useful on the ogan enemies (like Dorino Inn foretold, you're
going to want to burn their clubs), plus magic is helpful.

 Head into the mountains where you'll find two ogan and two bellbirds to kill.
The ogans aren't much of a challenge here, but the bellbirds WILL counter with
confuse if you don't take them out in a single blow so be careful. Either take
them out with extreme predjudice or be ready with panacea. You can find '300G'
in the chest on the left here. Head up the screen and you'll soon see a scene
near the top.

 Well, it looks like we found the hero anyways! Take out the single ogan
chasing him and another one will come down, but this one will have a hammer
with him! Remember the tip from Dorino Inn? This ogan is much tougher with
his hammer, but you can cast FIRE on him with Lucca and turn him into a normal
ogan again. After the fight Tata will tell us to run and he'll take off again.
Head north to another screen WITHOUT going up the ladder. There's a small area
down here to explore with a partially-hidden chest near the start that houses
a 'Mirage Hand' for Robo. Nice!

 Go back and head up the ladder now and immediately go south to the previous
screen for that chest we saw earlier. It has some 'Athenian Water' in it. Head
back up and nab the chest on the left for an 'Ether'. The ogan here is asleep
but when you head north a ninja-like bird called a freelancer. A cool-looking
enemy! Burn the ogan's hammer and take them both out. Head north over the
bridge and up the ladder to face two more ogan! Only one has a hammer, so burn
it while Crono and Marle take out the other one (Crono needs something to do
anyways...). Be sure to grab the chest past the ogan for '500G' afterwards.
Keep following the path to take out one more ogan before coming to a new area.

 Head right through the shade and you'll see the path branch off a bit. Head
NORTH to get to a chest with a 'Mid-Ether' in it. Go back down and all the way
to the right to fight some freelancers and find another chest with some more
'Athenian Water'. Head up the ladder now and open another chest on the left
for a 'Golden Helm'. Nice!

 Head up the second ladder to fight another club ogan, then head off to the
left for a second battle against an ogan and a freelancer. From the second
battle site, be sure to fully explore to the south to find a ladder and a
treasure chest with a 'Mid-Potion' in it. Head back up and to the left to
reach a new screen.

 In this next screen a freelancer will be on the other side of the canyon
chucking rocks at you. Bah, we can't do anything to him so just keep moving
so you don't get hit. Be sure to grab the chest on your way up to find a
'Mid-Ether' before going right to a new screen. Here you will fight another
ogan and freelancer before going up a ladder and fighting two more
freelancers. Grab the nearby chest afterwards for '600G' and then heal up
before moving to the next screen.

 Oh, quite a view! Here you'll have to fight a series of battles one after
another. There's four in total but it's just normal enemies. Just be sure to
cast fire on the ogans and you'll be fine. Head to the next screen and grab
the '300G' from the chest then head north. A couple of freelancers are
sharpening their blades down below. As you head towards them a bellbird will
alert them to your presence starting a fight. Take out the freelancers first,
of course.

 Now here be careful of going out into the water as it'll drag you down to
the bottom of the screen, so stick to the right wall to go up and grab the
'Mid-Potion' from the chest. Now let's go down the waterfall, but make sure
you go down the LEFT side (you can only really go down either the left or
right sides), because if you go LEFT you can grab the 'Silver Stud' from the
chest. This handy accessory reduces MP consumption by 50%! Sweet. Now go press
'A' near the right-hand ledge to jump down further. Down here is a chest with
a 'Silver Earring' in it, which boosts max HP by 25%. From here take the NE
exit to a familiar screen, then go N and E from there to get back to the
waterfall area.

 Now head to the northwest corner to find a slope leading up to land. There
is a freelancer here that you can ignore (Quiet, you'll ruin our ambush!),
but be sure to grab the 'Mid-Ether' from the chest on the left. Head down now
to fight two freelancers before going left to another screen.

 Here head to the left and battle the three bellbirds that appear. Beyond
that is a bridge and a monster appreciating the view (it IS a nice view). Now
be sure to talk to him FOUR times (bugging him) to make him give you a 'Magic
Capsule'. Sweet! Head down afterwards to a new screen.

 In this screen you'll see a beautiful, sparkly save point! Yes! Use a shelter
here and SAVE! Go down the nearby ladder and open the chest on the right for a
'Mid-Ether'. We sure are getting a lot of these! Head down another ladder and
check under the foliage on the left for a 'Speed Capsule' (you'll be pressing
A blindly here, but it's there!). Head to the right now to continue on.

 On this screen you'll have to deal with the rock-throwing freelancer again!
There's a partially-hidden chest just to your north with a 'Golden Suit' in
it. Go down the ladder now (its one-way) and fight the three regular ogan
below you. After the fight be sure to grab the chest to your northwest for a
'Shelter'. Now it's time for our revenge on the annoying rock-chucker. Head up
the ladder after him and he'll knock you down. Go hit him again and you'll
face two hammer ogan and two freelancers! Use Lucca's "Napalm" on the two ogan
if you can (you should DEFINITELY have Napalm, Cleave, and Cure by now) to
make the fight easier. Head up the ladder now and enter the cave.

 Inside the cave you can talk to the young child if you wish, then head up
to inspect the blade. Before you can touch it, the child will comment on how
greedy humans are and call out his brother! Well, it seems the Masamune is
personified, and you've just met the brothers Masa and Mune!

 |  Masa will counter you EVERY TIME with X-Strike (which doesn't hurt TOO   |
 |  much), but Mune won't. So obviously you want to lay into MUNE as much as |
 |  you can. Keep HP up near your max as you fight though. Keep laying into  |
 |  Mune and once you knock him off the fight will be over.                  |

 +===========================================================================+

 After that fight, the brothers will "get serious", merging their power
together to take on a new form:

|  Party lv | Crono 16, Marle 15, Lucca 15                                    |
\=============================================================================/
 |                                                                           |
 |   Strategy: Well, HERE is a challenge! Masa & Mune are much bigger and    |
 |  tougher now! He's also got some high-damaging moves. "Doublehand Chop"   |
 |  is by far his most common move, but it'll still do 70-80 damage! You     |
 |  will want to stay above 100 HP for the entire fight!                     |
 |                                                                           |
 |   The BIGGEST thing to be aware of here is the "Vacuum Wave" attack. You  |
 |  will see Masa & Mune stop moving and "Gather Wind Energy". When you see  |
 |  that IMMEDIATELY have Crono do his "Wind Slash" attack to disappate the  |
 |  energy they stored (a trick you should have learned from Denadoro Inn).  |
 |  Left unguarded, Vacuum Wave will hit everyone for high damage.           |
 |                                                                           |
 |   SO... Stay above 100 HP and be sure to use "Wind Slash" and you should  |
 |  come out on top! Use your most damaging attacks (Antipode Bomb and the   |
 |  Cleave/Sword attacks) and be ready with any emergency Mid-Potions!       |
 |                                                                           |
 +===========================================================================+

 After the fight the brothers will entrust themselves to you, hoping that you
will find a way to rebuild them. They will combine with the sword above and
bestow upon you the 'Broken Blade'. You can also "Ride the Wind" where the
sword once was to return to the base of the mountain.

 We are going to make a couple of short trips now before moving onto the next
section, so follow along with me!

 Out on the world map, head south to Porre and head into Tata's house. You'll
find the little tyke here who will tell you the truth: He found the badge
after Frog dropped it at the bar! Huh! He'll tell you that he's no hero after
all and gives you the 'Hero's Badge'. This accessory boosts the critical hit
rate of the Masamune, so remember it later!

 For now, let's head back to the Cursed Woods. Head back to Frog's house and
Crono will tell him about acquiring the Hero's Badge and the Broken Masamune.
Frog will be impressed, but is still very depressed since the Masamune is
broken and no one in his era can fix it. He'll FINALLY move away from the spot
he was standing in and you'll see that familiar blue sparkle! Go check it out
to find the 'Broken Hilt', which Lucca will find some inscription on that says
"M E L C H I O R"! Hey, we know him! He's from OUR time, we last saw him near
Medina Village!

 Head back to the End of Time and go into the "Medina Village 1000AD" gate
(which is right next to the one you came out of). Exit the house and go see
Melchior at his house to the southwest. He will marvel at the Masamune and
tell you that he could reforge it if he had some DREAMSTONE, the material from
which it was made. However, he says that you could never find any as it
existed long, long ago, longer than we could even imagine...

 "Longer than we could even imagine...". Our quest to reforge the sword and
redeem Frog's honor is not over yet, for one more trip back to the End of Time
may send us to long, long ago (*hint-hint, 65,000,000 B.C)...

"Ioka village fight reptite. Leader name Azala. Azala very smart." -- Ayla


   <vin> Welcome back y'all! Missed me?! ^_~ I did!

 Once we arrive... we fall down... WTF!!!? Afterwards, we see several green
headed monsters running around like crazy. You'll also be in a battle straight
away with 5 Reptites. Just use Fire Whirl and you're good to go. After the
battle, a nice little anime cutscene triggers introducing Ayla. Very nice. She
takes with her some Reptites, then you get to fight some more. Yay...

 Once they're gone and we regain control, go right and follow Ayla. On the next
screen, open the green chest on the left to find 'Berserker Ring'. Now run S,
fight the Crested Sprinter that are running around, go S some more and kill the
Spekkio-looking creatures called Kilwala. Keep on going S, kill the Crested
Sprinters and Kilwalas if you like and go S to exit the Mountains.

 Once at the World Map, there's not much to do at the moment, so go NE to find
some Huts. You can speak to the amazed prehistoric citizens if you desire, you
can enter the hut on the bottom right corner and speak to the girl on the left
in here to get fully healed. Nice. Now leave this village and enter the upper
left hut to find Ayla.

 Speak to her and you'll now be at some kind of party celebrating the new
friendship between Ayla and Crono...

   <vin> Man, making a bond that quickly is... mmm... awesome! =D

 Start talking to everybody here, including your party. Speak several times
with Marle as well until you start dancing with her, just like you did at the
Millennial Fair. Once you're done dancing, speak to Ayla and you'll enter a
drinking match with her, once again just like at the Millennial Fair. Quickly
press A as fast as you can.

 If you win, you'll get the 'Dreamstone' (You'll get it regardless even if you
don't win, so just keep trying!). We now wake up with a horrible hangover...
lol. Speak to the party and now the keystone will be gone. Dammit. Speak to
Ayla and she'll join your party, but only for the era, at the moment. She's
awesome and very strong, so I recommend taking Marle with you, just to use her
Healing arts. Leave the hut and before going to get the Gate Key back, let's do
some other things that will net you some awesome new equipment.

 Go N from Ioka Village and instead of going up to the mountain, go right and
find a new area by the woods to enter...

 This place is not story-related and it's totally optional, but we get some
items here, and get some other items that we can use to trade for that awesome
new equipment I told ya about. From where we start, go N and kill the
Prehistoric Frog... 3 of them actually. The items we obtain from the enemies in
this area are: Petals, Fangs, Horns and Feathers. We need to get several of
these, so there will be a lot of fighting...

   <vin> The weather in this area changes from sunny to raining. The Nu enemy
   only appears when it's raining and it appears at the NW corner of the area,
   the SE corner (on higher grounds) and the NE corner.

 From here go E and fight another Prehistoric Frog. Go N from here and go W
when possible to find another enemy, the Ion Cloud. Kill 'em and you'll see a
vine going up to the upper area N of the Ion Clouds. Don't go up yet, so return
to the entrance, go W and N at the first fork to find another Prehistoric Frog.
N of his Frog is an Ion Cloud, so kill it as well. Go W from here and if it's
raining, a Nu will appear.

 An easy way to kill it is to use Ice Sword on it twice to deal around 500 dmg.
3 of those and it'll go down. Also, it gives you 30AP, which is awesome. You'll
receive 3x Petals, 3x Fangs, 3x Horns and 3x Feathers. Once you defeat it,
it'll try and run. Speak to it before it disappears and it'll give you 'Third
Eye'.

 That's all there is to it and to this area. Make sure you get 9x Petals, 21x
Fangs, 21x Horns and 33x Feathers. Once you have all these, return to Ioka
Village and enter the NE hut, right of Ayla's. In here, speak to the central
old man and he'll trade those items for equipment. Here's a little list:
 __________________________________
|================.===.=============|   Make sure to grab Lucca's Ruby Gun,
|    3 of each   |   |  Equipment  |  Marle's Shaman's Bow, Robo's Stone Arm,
|----------------'---'-------------|  Crono's Mammoth Tusk, a Ruby Vest and
| Petal + Fang .......... Ruby Gun |  Stone Helm for Crono, Marle, Lucca, Robo
| Petal + Horn ...... Shaman's Bow |  and Frog, for when we get him back.
| Petal + Feather ...... Stone Arm |
| Fang  + Horn ...... Mammoth Tusk |   As you can see, these are very nice and
| Fang  + Feather ...... Ruby Vest |  give you a nice boost on your stats, just
| Horn  + Feather ..... Stone Helm |  what we need for the upcoming dungeons.
|__________________________________|
'=================================='   Now, leave the hut and it's time to go
                                      get our Gate Key back, so from the Ioka
Village, did you notice a forest near Mystic Mountains? On the right just S of
Ioka Village? Well, that's our destination, so go S from Ioka Village (make
sure to heal at the SE hut) and save your game before entering...

 <bk> I'd like to point out that you COULD spend time leveling up Ayla to
      learn the technique "Charm". Charm lets Ayla STEAL items from enemies.
      Of course, now that we finally have Ayla this is our first real chance.
      However, it's going to take you quite a few battles to learn Charm (it
      is about 850+ Technique Points to learn). There are some decent items
      to steal though, if you're up for it. Particularly the Magma Hand from
      Reptite (Green), the Dreamstone Gun from the Aecyto Weevil, the Primeval
      Blade from the Megasaur, the Dreamstone Bow from the Rafflesia, and the
      Third Eye from the upcoming boss. You can get each of these later though
      so it's up to you.

"Kino man... Ayla die, Ayla have baby, then Kino chief." -- Ayla


 As we get control, go E across the trees and open the yellow chest just S of
you to get 'Mid-Potion'. Now go down the vine to the NE of the chest and open
the chest S to find 'Athenian Water'. As you try to move forward, a pair of
Golden Eaglet attack you...

   <vin> These Golden Eaglets tend to transform into the Red Eaglets, which
   absorbs Fire. Be cautious.

 Take care of 'em, go down the vine and down here, go E across the tree root
that doubles as a bridge... not before being attacked by a trio of Kilwalas.

 Now cross the root bridge and go S to find a chest with 'Mid-Potion'. Now go N
and go W at the fork to find a 'Mid-Ether'. Return to the fork, go E until you
reach a chest with 'Athenian Water' (on the left side of what seems to be a
fork). Now go E from this fork and after going under an arch, look on the S
side to find a chest with 'Shelter'.

 Now go E from the chest to get on the upper path. Follow this path, kill the
enemies that pop out and when you get to a fork, look S to see a chest on the
ground level. Go W all the way until you get to a chest with 'Mid-Potion'. Go N
from the fork just before chest, kill the enemies, then go S to find a chest
with 'Panacea'.

 Go down the vine and go E all the way to get to that chest we saw, which
contains 'Mid-Ether'. Now go W to exit to the World Map, in which the only
place you can go in is...

"I suppose you need some... motivation. So be it!" -- Azala


 As you enter, go E into the next area, which is kinda strange how it follows
from here. Basically, this dungeon is very short, but from this room with the
Aecyto Weevils, you will have to choose a hole to follow (the weevils dig
holes). Just wait for a bit and you'll see them dig holes! You can drop down
from these holes into 4 different rooms. Don't worry though, we can get back to
this room later to fully explore every hole! They dig in the following
locations:

 Note: If you encounter a Megasaur, be sure to have Crono cast lightning on it!

 The secret to this entire area is WHERE the hole is that the weevil dug.
LOCATION is very important here. What you need to do is basically just cut this
first room into FOUR parts, which will lead to different routes through this
area. Note that you can STOP the weevil from digging at any time by TALKING to
it. Here's the paths you can take:

 I'll cover 1 hole at a time:

 NORTHWEST HOLE :: 2 Weevils, 1 Megasaur (No Treasure!).


 SOUTHWEST HOLE :: 1 Weevil 1 Rafflesia 1 Mid-Ether, 1 Weevil 1 Rafflesia
                   1 Hi-Potion.


 NORTHEAST HOLE :: 2 Weevil 2 Rafflesia 1 Mid-Ether (Note: This room has a hole
                   to the left, but if you WAIT you can get the Weevil to dig a
                   hole to the right too).

      LEFT HOLE :: 2 Weevil 1 Rafflesia 1 Ruby Vest.

     RIGHT HOLE :: 1 Elixir.


 SOUTHEAST HOLE :: 1 Weevil 1 Rafflesia 1 Hi-Potion (Note: This room has a hole
                   to the left, but if you WAIT you can get the Weevil to dig a
                   hole to the right too).

      LEFT HOLE :: 2 Weevil 1 Rafflesia 1 Ruby Vest (Note: This is the SAME
                   room from the NORTHEAST path).

     RIGHT HOLE :: 1 Megasaur 2 Weevil 1 Rafflesia 1 Hi-Ether.


 Regardless of which path you choose, you'll end up at the bottom eventually!

 Once at the bottom, grab the chest on the SW side to find 'Stone Helm' and
'Hi-Ether' from the NE chest. Now kill all the Reptites running around and go E
to the next area. Kill the Bao Bao on the S if you want to, then go N, kill
another Bao Bao and some Mossbacks. To the left is a room with a set of ladders
that you can take to get back to the first room, by the way, so if you care
about nabbing all the loot here take them back up! Otherwise go N to a pair of
Reptites and a Megasaur. Shelter yourself back to health, save your game using
the Save Point that appeared.

 Now go N to the next area to trigger a little scene with Azala, as well as...

 |   Strategy: Let's take a look at Nizbel's attack first, since they can    |
 |  be deadly. His Charge and Earthquake techs are nothing to worry about,   |
 |  since they both deal less than 50 dmg., Charge to one character and      |
 |  Earthquake to all characters. The real problems come with Electric       |
 |  Discharge. It deals over 150 Lightning dmg. against all characters,      |
 |  releasing the Lightning dealt by Crono and putting up his awesome DEF    |
 |  again.                                                                   |

 |   Nizbel may look intimidating, but he's easy. Before anything, you MUST  |
 |  have Crono use Lightning on him. He has an astounding DEF and your       |
 |  characters will be dealing very low dmg. on him. Crono's Lightning       |
 |  lowers his DEF, making it easier to dmg. Nizbel. After Lightning, have   |
 |  Ayla spam Cat Attack and Crono spam Cleave.                              |
 |                                                                           |
 |   Have Marle on standby always, ready to use Cure on anyone who needs it. |
 |  Once Nizbel uses Electric Discharge, quickly use Cure and have Ayla and  |
 |  Crono use Mid-Potions on 'em. That's pretty much it.                     |
 |                                                                           |

 Watch the scenes after the fight and now we're ready to leave the Prehistoric
 era...

   <vin> If you're low on money, you can always go to the Hunting Range and get
   some Petals, Horns, Fangs and Feathers; then trading them. Getting items
   here are a good way to get Gold, just go and sell them at another era.

   <bk> If you were wondering, the door where Nizbel came out of just leads
   to another exit from the Reptite Lair.

 Now return to the Mystic Mountains and use the gate to return to the End of
 Time.

"My name is Glenn! Long have I carried Cyrus's hopes and dreams, and now I
bear the Masamune as well! Henceforth, I claim them as my own!"
                                                                   -- Frog

 <Bkstunt> Hey, I'm back guys! Let's do this!

 Once we're at the End of Time, head over to Medina Village at 1000AD. Head
over to Melchior and he's amazed that you have some Dreamstone. Go downstairs
and speak to both Melchior and Lucca (or whoever is helping him) over and
over. You'll soon see them hard at work restoring the Masamune. Once you're
done, you'll be presented with the 'Masamune'! Finally! You can speak to him
again and sell all the extra equipment you got from trading (if you did get
any...).

 Note: Now that we're done with our first trip to the past, we can head over
to Lucca's House and talk to her dad to get the 'Taban's Helm'. He'll start
work on his next piece!

 After that, head to the End of Time and head to Truce Canyon at 600AD. We've
got a hero to recruit! Make your way back to Frog's Grotto, where Crono will
present him with the Masamune... Frog will have to ponder these turn of events
and invites you to stay for the night.

 This leads to a series of cutscenes. The knight Cyrus will leave the castle
on a quest to retrieve the Hero's Badge from the FrogKing with his companion
Glenn. After much fighting (and a Nirvana Strike) they'll obtain the badge.
However, they'll also run into Magus and Ozzie... watch what happens. Poor
Frog. He'll decide to come with you to Magus's Keep.

 Pick a third party member now (I'm taking Marle). Note that you CAN'T equip
the Masamune on Frog... yet. Also be sure to equip Frog with the armor we
picked up from 65m BC. Head out to the world map now and head BACK to the
End of Time! We need to see Spekkio! Talk to him with Frog in tow and Frog
will learn MAGIC! Yes!!!

 Head back to Truce Canyon 600AD. Now head down past Zenan Bridge and head
to the Magic Cave (to the right of Fiona's Villa).

 Here you will see another set of scenes, some of my absolute favorite
scenes in the entire game. There's also a beautiful cut-scene here. So very
touching...

 After the scenes, you'll be inside of the cave. Now is a good time to STOP
and EQUIP the MASAMUNE on Frog. You can also equip the Hero's Badge on him
to up his critical hit percentage. Try out your new sword on the nearby
enemies. This first fight is a vampire bat and some grimlings. Note that
you'll want to use magic on the grimlings. You may also note the bat that is
following us as we head into the cave. Continue on after the fight to see a
black box that we can't open yet.

 Past that is another fight, but after this one you'll see a WAVE of grimlings
rush through the cave. Follow them and you'll have to fight them all at the
base of some stairs. Naturally you want to use a MASS MAGIC attack to kill
them all at once (Wind Slash or Ice Water work well....). After that you'll
have another (easy) battle, but then you can head up the stairs to find a
knight. Before dying, the knight wrote a LONG message in blood, warning you to
beware of the jugglers in the Fiendlord's keep. Apparently if you hit them
they become resistant to physical, and if you use magic on them they become
resistant to magic. Head out of the cave to get back to the World Map. Be sure
to save guys, because out here there's only one place you can go:


                         The Fiendlord's Keep!

"Again, the bitter black winds begin to howl..."   -- Magus


 Upon nearing the keep, you'll see a little scene. You'll also notice that
the bat is STILL following us... Head up the stairs and you'll see doors on
both the left and the right. Let's head to the left first. Up here you'll find
a variety of... let's say humans. Be sure to grab the 'Mid-Ether' in the chest
on your way up this room to the stairs at the end. In the next room go up the
stairs. You'll see a throne here along with two chests containing a 'Shelter'
and another 'Mid-Ether'. Make your way to the right door now.

 More humans. These children surround the first treasure chest, so skip it
for now. In the next room you'll find the "King" and "Nadia". Hmph. The chest
here has a 'Mid-Ether' in it. Crono's mom is further north. Go up the stairs
to find another room with a throne it in. Now head back to the fork.

 Out here you'll see a new SAVE POINT! But wait, it's not a save point! Ozzie
will come out and tell you Magus is busy, so you'll have to deal with him,
Slash, and Flea... oh and the 100 beasts in this castle! With that you'll
fight 4 Underlings and 2 Vampire bats (focus on the underlings...).

 Head back up the right path now and talk to the lower kid. He'll ask if you
want his treasure. Say yes and all four kids will turn into shadows... cast a
hit-all magic attack to take them out easy and claim the 'Barrier Sphere' item
from the chest. Head up into the next room where the king will turn into a
sorcerer. Focus on him first, he can heal EVERYONE. Be careful though, he
absorbs most magic. He's weak to fire though. Head up and deal with Nadia and
Crono's Mom as well.

 Enter the next room where Frog will challenge the magician Flea! Just pull
off a quick combo during the ensuing fight. The enemy will use MP BUSTER at
the end, draining a random character of MP before dying? Well, that's not
much of a "Boss" is it!? (Note that the game still considers this guys a boss,
calling it "Flea?"! Hehehe...) Frog will comment on that too while the bat
that's been following us laughs and changes into a girl... or wait, a guy?!
Huh O_O !? Let's just call it "Flea" and be done with it. It's time to play
afterall...

 |   Strategy: Ok, time to deal with this he/she freak. Check out his techs  |
 |  above. See how most of them are STATUS effects? Crazy, right? OK, keep   |
 |  that in mind. The FIRST thing you should do is have WHOEVER lost their   |
 |  MP from Flea?'s "MP BUSTER" attack use a Mid-Ether on themselves. Now,   |
 |  you basically NEED a party member on standby, ready to use a PANACEA at  |
 |  any time. You DEFINITELY want to cure CONFUSION (Wind Waltz) as SOON as  |
 |  it happens. The other STATUS attacks are all PERCENTAGE based, so if you |
 |  are lucky, no one will be affected. I use Marle for this role, and HEAL  |
 |  with her whenever no status land or Flea uses a normal attack.           |
 |                                                                           |
 |   In the meantime I have Crono and Frog use X-Strike. It does good dmg.   |
 |  (around 400+), but you should always be ready to have either one of them |
 |  help out with a panacea if they need to! If your health is too low be    |
 |  sure to have them help out there too. Flea's most dangerous attack is    |
 |  "The Look", but thankfully it's pretty rare (X-Strike helps keep your    |
 |  attacks down, too). It makes Crono attack the party, dealing 70-100 dmg. |
 |  to everyone including Crono! Keep up the attacks and status healing and  |
 |  you'll be fine.                                                          |
 |                                                                           |
 +===========================================================================+

 After the fight be sure to gather up the 'Magic Capsule' Flea leaves behind.
You may also find yourself low on panacea's, so feel free to travel back to
the fork (battling more monsters if you wish) and go back out to the world map
and visit an inn/item shop if you need to (I know I did!).

 Whatever you end up doing, we'll have to explore the left-hand side now. You
will have to battle past some gaolers and lancers in this first room on your
way up to the second room. There are more lancers to kill here, so "free" them
and the second general, Slash, will show up.

 |   Strategy: This boss fight is more of a "warm-up" round than anything,   |
 |  so you REALLY shouldn't have any trouble. His best attack here is his    |

 |  towards him and punches you a gajillon times (totally a number). Be sure |

 Once you beat this form of Slash, he will comment that you have SOME prowess
and then he'll go grab his sword from the wall behind him, saying he'll fight
you on equal terms. Get ready, here he comes again!

 |   Strategy: Now here we have a fight. You're going to want to keep Marle  |
 |  (or whoever you have that isn't named Frog or Crono) on stand-by for     |
 |  healing. Cleave and Frenzy HURT after all. Slash is also pretty dang     |
 |  fast... he can easily Frenzy someone then Cleave them a few seconds      |
 |  later, so have someone ready to heal at all times. He can also be quite  |
 |  annoying with Wind Slash, and can line himself up to hit EVERYONE, so be |
 |  sure to heal with multiple people if you have to (potions) to keep your  |
 |  HP up.                                                                   |

 |   In the meantime, use X-Strike as much as possible for 400-500 dmg. You  |
 |  can avoid the Frenzy counter easily this way, but it will take a while   |
 |  to kill Slash. Keep up the healing and stay away from Water magic and    |
 |  you'll be victorious.                                                    |
 |                                                                           |
 +===========================================================================+

 After the fight you will be rewarded handily: Slash leaves behind a weapon
for you: the 'Slasher' (a good upgrade for Crono). You'll also get a save
point, so use a shelter and save. Good. Now that we've done that, head back
to the fork and you'll see that familiar save spot that Ozzie ambushed us at
earlier. Head into it to be transported to a new area. Here head north and
fight the ever-increasing amounts of common enemies. Just be sure to takeout
the sorcerer's first. At the top grab the 'Mist Robe' from the chest and talk
to Ozzie, who will call on Flea and Slash to help him out. When the don't
come, Ozzie flees up the stairs behind him. Give chase!

 In this next room, there will be conveyor belts scattered throughout the
room with large scythes coming down on them. Looks like Ozzie is at it again!
These blades are pretty easy to dodge though, so use your years of video-game
timing skills to continue on. Be sure to grab the 'Dark Mail' in the chest on
your way. Once you get halfway through, Ozzie will speed up the belts and
blades, so be extra careful. At the end he'll run off again. Grab the 'Death
Claw' from the chest (a good upgrade for Robo) and give chase yet again.

 You'll be outside now, needing to ascend the ramparts here. This part is a bit
quirky as well: as you ascend, roundillo's will roll downwards. You can use
the chains hanging here and there to avoid them if you want, or you can just
fight your way up. If you choose to fight, the "Flea?" looking enemies here
are called Jugglers, and you were warned about them in the Magic Cave, so if
you do choose to fight them, alternate between physical and magical attacks.
Enter the door at the top to continue.

 In here you'll see Ozzie standing by a device to the right... well this can't
be good. Walk forward in the middle of the hallway and BOOM, you'll drop down
to a room below where you'll have to fight a bunch of lancers. Use a hit-all
magic attack on them to kill them easily.

 Now, I WANTED you to drop down here, because there is a LOT of treasure to be
had! Go to the NORTHWEST corner to find two chests with a 'Mid-Ether' in one
and a 'Lapis' in another. Head over to the NORTHEAST corner now to find two
more chests for a 'Barrier Sphere' and a 'Shelter'. Now head to the SOUTHEAST
corner to find a blue sparkle for a 'Magic Capsule'.

 Ok, the only other thing to note about this room is the FOUR save points that
you can find in each cardinal direction. Now, two of these are TRAPS (Enemies)
named "Save Point", ONE is an actual SAVE POINT, and the last one is a PORTAL
to the beginning of the trap-filled hallway. The location of the save point
enemies, portal, and save point change every time you fall down by the way...

 Once you do get back to where you were, follow the following diagram to get
through this area:

 As you can see by my drawing, you're going to want to stick to the left-hand
side until you reach the bottom, then stick to the bottom wall. As you go up
the right-hand side, stick to the middle. Notice how there is a TRAP right
before Ozzie, so go around the right-hand side (about TWO spaces before Ozzie)
and Ozzie will run off yet again. Sheesh, this is getting old. Keep after him!

 You'll be outside yet again, in a situation similar to before where you must
climb the ramparts. You can choose to be sneaky if you wish, but there are a
few new enemies here, including the outlaw (an upgraded freelancer) and the
roundillo bomber (who can quite literally blow up in your face for decent dmg.
if you aren't careful). Continue up the ramparts and enter the door.

 In here you will have to head north, but every few chains that you pass you
will have to fight some enemies. Not too hard, but during the last few fights
use a hit-all magic attack (like Ice Water) on the jugglers to START the fight
then you can just attack physically. At the end Ozzie will get MAD and run off
again. Grab the 'Speed Belt' here and follow him yet again.

 In this next room you will get into fights if you run between the gargoyles.
Note that you can walk AROUND the statues to skip the fights if you wish, its
your call. At the end is some 'Athenian Water' and another staircase. You'll
have to go through another battle before going up the stairs though.

 This next room is HUGE. You can sneak up the right-hand side for a 'Magic
Scarf' if you wish, with a 'Mist Robe' on the left-hand side. Go talk to
Ozzie now for a boss fight!

 |   Strategy: This fight is easy as pie if you know what you're doing.      |
 |  First of all, NEVER attack Ozzie. As you can see he is encased in...     |
 |  something, and he'll just damage everyone anyway. Instead, attack the    |
 |  lever's around the place (they show up as "???"). Do this four times to  |
 |  take Ozzie out.                                                          |
 |                                                                           |
 +===========================================================================+

 After the fight, two "save points" will show up. Use the RIGHT one with a
shelter if you need to and save your game. Now use the left one to be back
outside. Out here, bats will appear as you head downwards so either fight
them off or outrun them. Enter the door at the bottom to see another awesome
scene, leading to none other then the fiendlord himself...

 |                                                                           |
 |   Strategy: Here we are, the fight against the fiendlord himself! If ever |
 |  there was a time to be on top of your game, it's now. Naturally, you     |
 |  want a designated healer (Marle) in this fight. You'll soon find out     |
 |  after attacking Magus that he SHIFTS his weakness as you attack him. He  |
 |  does this by COUNTERING with the element he's now WEAK against (so even  |
 |  though the game says he absorbs EVERYTHING, it's not true).              |
 |                                                                           |
 |   Now, depending on your team you can't really take advantage of Magus's  |
 |  weakness. For example, with my team I can only really use Lightning or   |
 |  Ice. So, most of the time I just used X-Strike, until he became weak to  |
 |  Ice and I used Ice Sword (with the other party member healing). If you   |
 |  DO have Marle, she should also have HASTE by now, so you can have her    |
 |  use that as well. Frog may even have HEAL, which would help a ton...     |
 |                                                                           |
 |  At around half-health, Magus will start abandoning defense while he      |
 |  "casts a spell". He's casting Dark Matter, which takes him a few turns   |
 |  to cast but will hit everyone for around 250 dmg. EACH! While he is busy |
 |  casting this though, have everyone go ALL OUT on him. X-Strike's will do |
 |  around 500 damage and spells are fair game now, but once Dark Matter     |
 |  hits have everyone heal up ASAP! Keep yourself near max health and keep  |
 |  chipping away at his massive HP total and you'll defeat him.             |
 |                                                                           |

"Big frog present? For Ayla eat?" -- Ayla


   <vin> I'm back to walk you through the last bits of the Prehistoric Era.

 Ok, we get tossed back to the beginning of time, back to Ayla. She found us in
the Mystic Mountain. Thank you Ayla. We spend the night and now Kino comes in
and tells us that Ayla went over to Laruba Ruins, the other "ape" village. When
we regain control, leave Ayla's hut and time to do some more trading. If you
don't have enough material, go back to the Hunting Range to get some more.
 __________________________________
|================.===.=============|   Now go in the trading hut (upper right
|    3 of each   |   |  Equipment  |  one) and as you can see, there are new
|----------------'---'-------------|  equipment, well, new weapons for all 4
| Petal + Fang .... Dreamstone Gun |  characters... except for Frog... but hey,
| Petal + Horn .... Dreamstone Bow |  who needs a new weapon for him if you
| Petal + Feather ..... Magma Hand |  just got the Masamune? Thought so.
| Fang  + Horn .... Primeval Blade |
| Fang  + Feather ...... Ruby Vest |   Anyway, get one weapon of each, grab
| Horn  + Feather ..... Stone Helm |  some extra equipment just to sell if you
|__________________________________|  want, and leave the hut. Now onto Laruba.
'=================================='  Where is it? Go NW of Ioka Village across
                                      the forest to you'll see Laruba.

 In here, you'll see it's all foggy. Just what happened here? Go N and you'll
see Ayla and the Laruba chief speaking. Once it's over, time to go to the
Dactyl's Nest. Go N from Ioka and instead of going inside the Hunting Range, go
N some more and you'll see...

"No! Tyranno Lair danger! You no come! Maybe, all die!" -- Ayla


 As you enter, fight the Cave Ape and the Schists. Now go N all the way, kill
the Avian Rex as you try to climb the stepping stones. Reclimb them, open the
chest on the right to get 'Mid-Ether', and continue along the left side towards
the S side. 3 more Schists for you to kill, so do so, grab 'Mid-Potion' from
the SE chest and now go N along the right side until you reach the next area.

 Here, you'll have to fight 2 Cave Apes and a Schist whether you like it or
not, so go on all out. Now go N up the stepping stones (2 of them actually),
grab 'Mesozoic Mail' from the chest where the Schists are, equip it and go up
the stepping stones. As you try to go up the last stepping stones, you'll have
to fight 2 more Avian Rex. Meh. Kill 'em and go N to the last area.

 Here, just run N and speak to Ayla to trigger a scene and an animated
cutscene. Beautiful...

   <vin> No wonder we all fell in love with this game. <3

 Make up your party (I got Marle with me now) and now we can fly across the
skies of 65,000,000 BC. Nice. Go heal up at the hut, save your game and now
head to Tyranno Lair. Where is it? It's on a ledge on top of the lava in the
center of the map. You just can't miss it. Now land and enter...

"When I said she's through here, I meant you gotta get through me first!
 Whaddya think I was flexin' my muscles and lookin' all intimidatin' for?"
                                                                      -- Nizbel

 As we enter, kill the Cave Apes and the Reptite that appear here and enter the
upper right dragon mouth that's open and go down the stairs. Down here, you'll
have to fight some more Reptites. After killing them, open the cell where the
villagers from Laruba are and they'll flee... without even saying goodbye. What
jerks. Anyway, fight some more Reptites on the right side of the room...

   <vin> This is a good time to swap your 3rd party member so you can have
   him/her and Ayla learn some dual techs.

   <bk> I would recommend having Ayla learn her "Charm" skill as well now as
   some of the upcoming bosses have some good items to steal! You can learn it
   fairly fast by fighting Nu in the hunting range.

 Now go down the stairs and you'll have to fight 3 more Reptites. Mmm... we now
fight Kino, trapped. During the scene, Ayla rescues him. Before following Kino,
go inside the cell where he was trapped and open the sphere-looking chest to
find 'Mid-Ether'. Now go back up to the first floor and Kino will open the left
dragon mouth. Once down here, there are 2 paths to take and on both sides,
there are 2 enemies. There's also a switch. If you press the switch, you'll
avoid fighting the enemies.

 Do so if you want to and follow the right path. Outside, on the balcony,
you'll have to fight some Avian Rex, Volcanites and some Reptites. In the next
room, you'll see 2 sphere-shaped chests. If you open the left one, you'll get
'Hi-Potion'. If you open the right one, it'll trigger a trap and you'll fall
down to the room where you rescued the Laruba prisoners... and you'll have to
fight the enemies you dropped by stepping on the switches...

   <vin> lol, sorry, had to do it. XD

 Whether you fall down or not, return to the room where the enemies and the
switches are and go left this time. Some more Reptites are out here, so take
care of them and go in the next room. This one is kinda strange. What happens
here is that there are teleporters hidden on some tiles of the room, which are
also only one way. If you use it, you can't go back through it. You'll have to
run to the first one again. Here's a little ASCII I did for it.

 So, as you can see, it's very easy to follow...

   <vin> Thanks to my buddy Devin Morgan for making up that map at GameFAQs.
         http://www.gamefaqs.com/ds/950181-chrono-trigger/faqs/54949

 As you enter, you'll have to fight a Reptite, a Volcanite and a Terasaur. Now,
the best way to go from the entrance is to walk on top "c", grab the 'Athenian
Water', use "d", grab 'Mesozoic Mail', use "b" and grab 'Potion'. Now walk to
the S side and grab 'Triceratopper'. Now walk up to the NW corner to exit the
room. I took longer drawing the ASCII XD.

 In the next floor, just go out to the balcony. More fights out here. There are
3 doors in this part. The left one (we just used to get out here), the central
and right one. Go inside the right one and you'll have 2 switches on the floor.
The left one opens up the dragon mouth, letting enemies come out. Dammit. The
right one only opens the mouth. Pick whichever, go through and press the switch
to open the central door back at the balcony.

 Try going inside and you'll fight some more enemies...

   <vin> Just how many enemies are there? This is starting to feel like a
   Prehistoric version of Magus's Keep >_>.

 In here, you'll find Nizbel... again. Speak to him and he'll tell you Azala is
just upstairs. What? No fight? Anyway, go past him, Shelter and save your game.
Rearrange your party and go upsta... what? lol, ok, so now we gotta fight...

 |   Strategy: Ok, the strategy against Nizbel II is pretty much the same    |
 |  as his previous version. As for his attacks, he has the same as his      |
 |  previous version, with just one more, and a tab more powerful. His       |
 |  Charge deals around 80 dmg. to one character. Nizbel Charge is the same  |
 |  as Charge, only against all characters and a tad weaker. Earthquake is   |
 |  just like Nizbel Charge, all characters... and weak. His Electric        |
 |  Discharge. It deals between 150 and 180 Lightning dmg. against all       |
 |  characters, releasing the Lightning dealt by Crono and putting up his    |
 |  awesome DEF again.                                                       |
 |                                                                           |
 |   As for strategy, this time, you can only attack him with Lightning,     |
 |  since physically attacking him will raise his DEF. Dang it. So pair up   |
 |  with Ayla and start using Thunder Chomp dual tech over and over. This    |
 |  will deal over 1,000 dmg. to Nizbel. This is the only attack you need    |
 |  to kill him. Have Marle/Frog the full time healer. If you brought Marle  |
 |  with you, you can speed things up even more by casting Haste on both     |
 |  Crono and Ayla. With around 6 Thunder Chomps, you'll take Nizbel down    |
 |  for good.                                                                |

 +===========================================================================+

 After the fight, re-Shelter yourself again and save your game. Now go up the
stairs at the end of the room and you'll be at another balcony with 3 doors.
Enter the right-most one and this time you'll have 3 switches which form a
triangle.

   Left :: Opens holes in the floor.
 Middle :: Pop's up a Save Point.
  Right :: Makes 2 Terasaur enemies appear (not nice).

  Go through the dragon head, press the switch to open the door back at the
balcony and open the sphere-shaped chest to find 'Hi-Ether'. Return to the
balcony and enter the central room to find Azala. After the little talk, she'll
run away, but before following her, open the sphere-looking chests to find
'Triceratopper' and 'Mid-Ether'. Now follow her to find... WTF is THAT?! O.O;

 Looks pretty nice, no? Haha, either way, you'll have to fight...

 |                                                                           |
 |   Strategy: Ok, so this battle is just as epic as Magus' battle, well,    |
 |  not THAT epic, but still epic nonetheless. Let me start with their       |
 |  attacks. Azala's first. Psychokinesis deals around 60 dmg. to one        |
 |  character. Meh. Teleport deals around 80 dmg. to one character.          |
 |  Telepathy only inflicts Sleep on one character, so use a Panacea ASAP.   |
 |  Azala's Wrath is used when she dies, and inflicts Sap.                   |
 |                                                                           |
 |   Black Tyranno's now. Firebreath deals around 50 dmg. to one character.  |
 |  Chomp deals a whopping 250+ dmg. to one character, plus it absorbs that  |
 |  amount of dmg. Dammit. Roar inflicts Sap on all characters and Tyranno   |
 |  Flame deals a whopping 250+ dmg. to all characters.                      |
 |                                                                           |
 |   The first thing you need to know is that Azala is the one that has to   |
 |  go down first. If you don't take her out first, you'll never be able to  |
 |  kill Black Tyranno. Now, a good thing to do is to cast Haste at the      |
 |  beginning of the fight and then have Marle stick with Cure. Ayla should  |
 |  be either another healer with Kiss or just on standby to use a Panacea.  |
 |  Crono should stick with Lightning. Don't bother with Lightning II.       |
 |  Black Tyranno will just use Chomp and heal itself up, and you'll be      |
 |  wasting a ton of MP. Also, don't even use Thunder Chomp. It deals less   |
 |  dmg. than Lightning alone, oddly enough.                                 |
 |                                                                           |
 |   It'll take a while until you get Azala out of the way since you're      |
 |  only damaging her with Crono, but you'll just have to endure. Once       |
 |  she's out of the way, you'll see that Black Tyranno'll use Roar          |
 |  (probably even a bit before Azala dies) and a countdown appears. When    |
 |  the counter goes from 5 to 0, it'll unleash Tyranno Flame, dealing those |
 |  massive dmg. on all characters. During the countdown, you'll be able to  |
 |  dmg. Black Tyranno, so quickly use Thunder Chomp as many times as you    |
 |  can.                                                                     |
 |                                                                           |
 |   Also have Marle keep the party healed completely for the upcoming       |
 |  Tyranno Flame. After the attack, keep on using Thunder Chomp while Marle |
 |  heals. She should get the necessary turns to get everyone healed.        |
 |  Thunder Chomp should deal around 450 dmg. when its DEF is up and over    |
 |  1,000 dmg. when DEF is lowered.                                          |
 |                                                                           |

"The black winds howl. One among you will shortly perish."   -- Janus


  <Bkstunt> I'm back. Let's explore this new area!

 After exiting the time gate you'll be in a cave. Head out to the world map
here and you'll see you're actually in 12,000 BC! Yikes! It's pretty much a
frozen wasteland out here. To the left is a "Terra Cave" that we can't do
anything with, so head to the right and enter the "Skyway". There's not much
in here besides a funky-looking floor, so step on it to be whisked away!

 Head south again and you'll find yourself... floating in the sky!? Nice!
The place you just came out of is a "Land Bridge". Head east to the "Enhasa".
Inside the monster on the right will tell you that you are in the Magic
Kingdom of Zeal! Go ahead and explore this place. You'll learn a LOT about
this new area and age. There is an item show in the lower left-hand corner
you can use if you wish. You'll also meet a peculiar kid... who will predict
that one of you is about to die! Wha!? Ok... The blue tile to the left also
restores your HP and MP completely. Very nice.

 You may have also noticed the books here that turn into fire, water, and
wind. As you may have guessed, there's a secret to be found here. Before
going on with this though, I recommend making your party FROG, AYLA, and
CRONO. This should give you the techs HEAL (Frog) and HOPEFULLY you'll also
have FALCON STRIKE (Chrono + Ayla). Save up on the world map, then go back
into Enhasa and hit those books in the following order:

   WATER --> WIND --> FIRE

 This will open up a room near the entrance. Inside you can find a book to
read (proclaiming Nu's are the best things in the world) and a Nu! He'll say
that the guru of reason is gone and will ask if you want to challenge him. Say
YES to enter your most challenging non-boss fight yet.

   SIX NU'S!!!

 Now this is a hard fight, but not TOO bad. The strategy here is to have FROG
cast HEAL every round, as the Nu's have an attack that will hit you for all
but ONE HP, and another that will hit you for ONE HP (or none). With Frog
healing every round you can overcome this (unless you're REALLY unlucky). Now
with Crono and Ayla, do FALCON STRIKE. Each Falcon Strike will hit 3 Nu's for
over half of their HP total, so after 2 rounds you should have killed 3 Nu's.
Now just do that to the remaining Nu's and you'll win! As a reward, the Nu
will give you a 'Magic Capsule' and a 'Speed Capsule' and then he'll disappear
from the room.

 After the fight, go back outside and enter the northern Land Bridge. You'll
end up back down on the wintery surface below. Head west/north-west to another
skyway, which will take you back up to the skies. Up here you can cross the
bridge to the left and you'll have a choice of three places to go: the small
cave to the right, the city to the north (Kajar), or the airport to the left
(Blackbird). The cave's lead up to the palace, so let's save that for later.
You can check out the Blackbird if you wish to meet Dalton and learn a thing
or two. After that enter Kajar.

 In Kajar talk to everyone to learn even more about this age. You'll learn
about Janus and Schala as well. You can even meet the man who created those
skill capsules we've been using. There's also a Nu here that tells us the
solution to the magic books puzzle (which I spilled earlier) and a man who
states that the Moon Stone could turn into the Sun Stone if left in a sunny
place for Aeons. Interesting.

 Well then, let's get down to nabbing stuff. In the first room, in the upper
right-hand corner, you noticed the familiar blue glow, right? Well, enter the
door here and go up the right stairs. Now examine the SOUTHERN WALL here to
find a 'Speed Capsule'! After that, go to the previous room and do the magic
book trick again:

   WATER --> WIND --> FIRE

 After hitting the books in the right order (Northwest, Southeast, Center)
you will open up a new area behind the bookshelf. Go inside and interact with
the center object to acquire the 'Black Gemstone'. This thing states that it
"Enables Eternal Darkness triple tech." We can't do anything with it for now
though, so don't worry about it.

 Ok, head back to the world map and make your way through the caves to the
right. You'll wind up at the palace. Head in and talk to the people. Of
special note, go talk to the ladies by the font of recovery (on the upper
section, to the south). The right lady here was given a special sapling from
the Guru of Life. She'll ask you if you like plants. Choose "YES". Next she'll
state the Queen told her to burn the sapling... Tell her to "GROW IT IN
SECRET". This starts a SIDE QUEST that we can do called the "THE SUNKEN
DESERT". Check this out in our side-quest section. I'd recommend holding off
on doing it now, though, until we can finish this area.

 Talk to everyone in this area for even more info. Masa and Mune are hanging
out here, crazily enough! In fact, the other monster we saw in Enhasa is their
sister Doreen! There's also a NU here that will ask you to scratch his back
for him! Do so to learn the "Nu backscratching technique"! Cool, I guess!?
Remember the Nu back in Kajar who wouldn't talk to us? You can go back there
now (through the annoying caves) and you will itch his back for him, making
him drop a 'Magic Capsule'. Ha!

   <bk> I recommend saving before going back to the palace, by the way. There
   is going to be a boss fight soon. We don't HAVE to win it though, but we
   could if we wanted to. I did. If you want to too, I would also recommend
   making sure you have plenty of Athenian Waters and Hi-Potions, and to put
   Ayla and Frog in your party.

 To progress the story, head up into the northeast door (the bedchambers) and
into the right room. You'll see Janus come talk to Schala. Schala will be
summoned to the Queens chamber shortly afterwards. Be sure to check out the
left room to learn more about Schala's pendant, then try to follow her.
You'll see a giant black door that she opens with her pendant (much like the
ones we've seen before). We can't follow her though, as our (Marle's) pendant
is not "powered up". This is an easy remedy though, just go visit the Mammon
Machine in the left door. Interact with the sparkle on it and Crono will power
up the pendant! Very nice! Now you can follow Schala into the Queens chambers.

 In the throne room, Queen Zeal will ask who you are. Inside you will see
Dalton, Schala, and the prophet that you've heard so much about. It seems the
prophet has already told the Queen that you're bad news. She'll tell Dalton
to seize you, which initiates a boss fight:

 |   NOTE: You do NOT need to WIN this fight to continue the game. In fact,  |
 |  given how tough Golem is you are SUPPOSED to LOSE. Unless you really do  |
 |  want the satisfaction of beating him, I would recommend stealing his     |
 |  magic capsule and then let him beat you.                                 |
 |                                                                           |
 |   Strategy: So, you want to BEAT him, huh? Well, it'll be tough! Notice   |
 |  how many techs he has up above. He won't use them though, basically if   |
 |  you leave him alone, all that he'll ever use is Energy Spheres and Iron  |
 |  Sphere. However, if you use magic, he'll counter with that SAME type of  |
 |  magic on EVERYONE, doing a LOT of damage. So our strategy will be to     |
 |  use physical attacks only. Basically what I did to win was to have Ayla  |
 |  use Boulder Toss over and over. Now while you do this Golem will be      |
 |  alternating between using Iron Sphere (which will never kill you but     |
 |  will half your HP) and Energy Spheres, which will hit for around 300 dmg |
 |  to one character. Oh yeah, Golem is FAST too, so you'll want to have     |
 |  Crono and Frog ready to administer Athenian Water and potions. It's a    |
 |  tough fight and will cost you quite a few items, but you CAN beat him.   |
 |  It's also very important to note that his counter move, Bluuurp!,        |
 |  activates once you defeat him, so make sure to have SOMEONE healed up    |
 |  when you think you are about to defeat Golem.                            |
 |                                                                           |

 Regardless of how the fight ended, you will be imprisoned by the Queen. Watch
the scenes that follow and you'll be essentially banned from Antiquity. Bah!
The party will then talk about the pendant that opened the door as the game
zooms to our next objective: The Keeper's Dome in 2300AD.

 Needless to say, we now have the power to open all those BLACK CHESTS and
BLACK DOORS, so we have a LOT of optional things to do (read: Treasure
Hunting). We'll go over that in the next section!
