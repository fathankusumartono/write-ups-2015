# Hack Dat Kiwi CTF 2015: Vigenere 1

**Category:** Crypto
**Points:** 50
**Solves:** 254
**Description:**

> Contrary to popular belief, in Cryptography, breaking a cipher is not the process of finding plaintext relating to a ciphertext.
> 
> Breaking a cipher (Cryptanalysis) is the process of finding the Key used to encrypt a data.
> 
> Once a Key is found, many instances of data can be decrypted. That's why in modern ciphers, even if you know the plaintext (or even select it), you should not be able to find the Key.
> 
> Vigenere is a classic cryptographic cipher. It is very simple, yet not that easy to break. Unless you break Vigenere on your own, you can't call yourself a cryptanalyst. Start with the simplest mode, Chosen Plaintext Attack: [sample.txt](./sample.txt)
